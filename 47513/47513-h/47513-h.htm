<h2 class="p4">PREFACE</h2>

<p class="drop-cap p2">THE aim of this book is to give in plain language
some account of a small, but noteworthy, group
of insects. I have avoided, whenever I could, using
the technical terms of zoology. To avoid doing so
entirely is impossible in a book which describes insects
in some detail. No technical term has, I hope, been
used without an explanation.</p>

<p>Over thirty years have elapsed since Taschenberg’s
German book, <i>Die Flöhe</i>, appeared. Our knowledge
has made enormous strides since then. More species
of flea are now known from the British Islands alone
than were then known from the whole world. So far
as I am aware, no book, devoted to what is known
about fleas, has ever been published in English.
The statements about these insects in the general
text-books of entomology are frequently antiquated
and inaccurate. But there is a fairly extensive
literature on the <i>Siphonaptera</i> scattered through
scientific periodicals mostly in English, German,
Italian, Dutch and Russian. I have given some
references in the Bibliography.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span></p>

<p>The naturalists now living who have devoted
any time to the special study of fleas may almost
be counted on one’s fingers. In England there
are Mr Charles Rothschild and Dr Jordan; in
the Shetland Islands, the Rev. James Waterston; in
Germany, Taschenberg of Halle and Dampf of
Königsberg; in Russia, Wagner of Kieff; in Holland,
Oudemans of Arnhem; in Italy, Tiraboschi of Rome;
in the United States, Carl Baker and a few others.
I have not mentioned medical men who have investigated
fleas in connection with plague.</p>

<p>There are small collections of fleas in the Natural
History Museums at South Kensington (London),
Paris, Berlin, Königsberg, Vienna, Budapest, S.
Petersburg and Washington. Of private collections
Mr Charles Rothschild’s at Tring is by far the best
in the world. It contains something like a hundred
thousand specimens and is most admirably kept.
I must express profound and sincere gratitude to
Mr Rothschild for having helped me in numberless
ways and advised me in many difficulties.</p>

<p>It is well known that the mere mention of fleas
is not only considered a subject for merriment, but
in some people produces, by subjective suggestion,
violent irritation of the skin. The scientific study of
fleas has, however, received a great impetus since it
has been ascertained that they are the active agents<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span>
in spreading plague. Rat-fleas are of various kinds,
and not all fleas will bite man. A knowledge of the
different species has suddenly become useful. The
humble, but ridiculous, systematist with his glass
tubes of alcohol for collecting fleas, his microscopic
distinctions, and Latin nomenclature has become a
benefactor of humanity. Some people seem to be
practically immune to the bites of fleas, but even to
such persons their visits are unwelcome. A famous
Frenchwoman once declared: “<i>Quant à moi ce n’est
pas la morsure, c’est la promenade.</i>”</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER I</h2>

<p class="pch">INTRODUCTORY</p>

<p><span class="beg">Fleas</span> form a group of insects that have, until
recently, been little studied by zoologists. We call
them insects because they are jointed animals, or
Arthropods, with three pairs of legs in the adult
condition. The reader will best understand the position
which fleas occupy in the general classification
of animals by remembering that the arthropods, or
jointed animals, are one of a dozen subkingdoms,
or phyla, to which the various members of the great
animal kingdom have been assigned. There is good
ground for believing that all the animals included in
each phylum trace their ancestry back to a common
primitive form which lived in more or less remote
ages. Besides (1) <i>Insects</i>, the arthropods, or jointed
animals, include (2) <i>Crustaceans</i>, such as crabs,
lobsters, shrimps, wood-lice, water-fleas and barnacles;
(3) <i>Myriapods</i>, such as centipedes and
millipedes; and (4) <i>Arachnids</i>, such as spiders, scorpions,
mites and ticks. To all these varied forms of
animal life fleas, and other insects, are therefore more
or less nearly related.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span></p>

<p>The animals belonging to this large and important
collection, which compose the arthropod phylum,
have certain common characteristic features. We
find a body made up of a series of more or less
completely similar segments placed one behind the
other. In this they resemble certain worms which
are far less highly organised. The body is elongated,
symmetrical on either side, and the mouth and anus
are at opposite ends. There is, however, an important
advance on the segmented worms. Each typical
segment carries a pair of appendages which are very
different from the foot-stumps that are found on
certain worms. These appendages of arthropods are
divisible into distinct limb-segments, separated from
one another by moveable joints, and acted upon by
special muscles.</p>

<p>The common ancestor of all the various arthropods
which are found living on the earth to-day, was
probably composed of a series of segments each very
similar to the last and each bearing a pair of very
similar appendages. In the course of ages, these
appendages have been astoundingly modified in form
and in function. So it happens that we find in the
arthropods of the present day pairs of antennæ, of
mandibles and other mouth-parts, of pincers, of legs,
of swimming-feet and of tail pieces which on close
examination can all be traced back to a common
structure. The body-segments, also, have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
strangely fused together and modified. All that
has been so far said applies equally to fleas and to
other insects.</p>

<p>It is of great interest, when one comes to make
a minute study of the form and external structure
of a flea, to try and trace the modifications that must
have taken place in the course of descent from the
ancestral arthropod; but the relationship of fleas to
other insects living at the present day is of more
immediate concern. Insects are highly specialized
arthropods and fleas are highly specialized insects.
This means that they have become vastly modified
from the primitive ancestral type and fitted thereby
for a life among certain defined and peculiar
surroundings.</p>

<p>It will be unnecessary to remind the reader who
knows anything of zoology or of botany that all
classification is now based on descent. Since
naturalists have abandoned a belief in the special
creation of the various species of animals now living
on the earth and have conclusively shown that they
have arisen by descent and modification from other
forms, the problem is to reconstruct a vast genealogical
tree. What then were the ancestors of the
fleas and to what other insects, in consequence, do
they appear to be related?</p>

<p>It is probable that the ancestors of the fleas were
winged insects, and that the organs of flight were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
gradually lost, as they became useless, when a
partially parasitic life was adopted. At one time
entomologists regarded fleas as wingless flies and
placed them in the order Diptera. Certain supposed
scaly plates on their bodies were regarded as the
atrophied relics of wings. It is, however, more than
doubtful whether this view is correct; and all modern
entomologists who have given any special study to
fleas are agreed that they are sufficiently unlike any
other living insects to deserve a place in an order by
themselves. To this order the name <i>Siphonaptera</i>
has been given: which means that the insects comprised
in it are provided with sucking mouths and
are destitute of wings. Another name for the order
is Aphaniptera, but this is gradually falling into
disuse. Linnæus (1758) only mentions two species
of flea: the human flea which he appropriately named
<i>Pulex irritans</i>, and the chigoe of hot countries which
he called <i>Pulex penetrans</i>, from the habit which the
female has of burrowing under the skin of her victims.
At the time of writing, about 460 species of flea have
been described and named; but some of the names
are doubtless synonymous, and the actual number of
separable species that have been discovered is somewhere
about four hundred. The vast majority of
these have been described within the last few years,
which shows what can be done when attention is
turned to any neglected group of animals. There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
can be no doubt that many undiscovered species still
remain, and will now, in due course, be collected,
described and named.</p>

<p>The position which should be assigned to the
order Siphonaptera in the general scheme of insect
classification is a question on which the most learned
modern entomologists have disputed with considerable
vigour. Some see the nearest relatives among the
beetles, others among the flies. The majority, as we
shall see later on, would place them near the Diptera:
but since no convincing arguments have been produced
on either side it may be wisest to regard the
question as still at present unsolved.</p>

<p>Fleas belong to one of the groups of insects which
go through a complete metamorphosis. Their life-history
consequently falls into four divisions: egg,
larva, pupa and imago. If the climate permits, the
female flea lays her eggs all the year round, and from
one to five are dropped at a time. Unlike those of
many other parasites they are never attached to the
hairs of the hosts, but appear to be deposited indiscriminately
on the floors of houses or in the nests
and sleeping places of their hosts. The eggs generally
hatch in a few days, and a minute, white, wormlike
larva emerges (<a href="#i6">Fig. 1</a>). The larvæ, of some, and possibly
of all, fleas are provided with a wonderful adaptation
in the shape of an egg-breaker or hatching-spine.
This is a thin plate, like the edge of a knife, where
the point of the head comes in contact with the shell.
The movements of the prisoner make a slight split in
the egg-shell, which then bursts asunder. This organ
has vanished in later larval life, and it is probably
lost after the first moult. The larva is legless and
has thirteen segments. It grows rapidly, and, as it
grows, moults its skin several times. It is provided
with mouth-parts adapted for biting, and eats any
decaying organic refuse. The larvæ may be reared on
the sweepings of an ordinary room or the dirty scurf
which collects at the bottom of old birds’ nests. It
is hardly necessary to add that the mother takes no
interest whatever in the larvæ and that the belief
that she feeds them on dried blood is not based on
any sound foundations.</p>

</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<p>The larval stage lasts some days, and the animal
spins a small cocoon before pupating. In the course
of a few more days, the time probably depending on
the weather, the perfect flea emerges. The larvæ
generally live in places where the perfect insects will
have an opportunity of finding a host as soon as
they leave the pupal envelope. The nests of their
hosts where the young are being reared are always
favourite places. It seems possible that the comparative
immunity from fleas which hoofed mammals
or Ungulates enjoy may be due to the fact that the
young beast follows its mother from the time of birth
instead of passing its early life helpless in a nest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p>Observations made on the development of the
dog-flea (<i>Ctenocephalus canis</i>) in India show that
eggs laid on October 17 hatched on October 19. The
larva spun its cocoon on October 25 and the mature
flea emerged on November 2. In Northern Europe
the human flea takes about four weeks in summer
and six weeks in winter to pass through its metamorphosis.</p>

<p>Unlike many parasitic insects, fleas do not constantly
pass their time upon the bodies of their
victims. The greater part of their life is probably
spent on the ground, in the house, or nest, of the
mammal or bird which serves them with blood. In
this respect there is considerable difference in the
habits of different species of flea. Some attach
themselves to an animal and actually burrow into
the skin. These are the most parasitic species.
Some only come to feed and leave to lay their eggs.
Many probably do not suck blood more than once
in their lives.</p>

<p>An animal which harbours fleas and which
nourishes the adult insect with blood is called a
<i>host</i>. No fleas are more than what is called
temporary parasites; which means that they pass
but a portion of their lives on their hosts and
frequently take occasion to hop on and off. All
fleas, apparently, go from host to host. The labours
of diligent collectors have proved that the great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
majority of mammals and birds have fleas. As a
general rule, it is true to say that certain species
of flea are associated with certain species of host.
Thus man is the true host of <i>Pulex irritans</i>; the
cat family are the true hosts of the cat-flea (<i>Ctenocephalus
felis</i>); and the dog family are the true
hosts of the dog-flea (<i>Ctenocephalus canis</i>). But the
human flea is sometimes found on cats and dogs, and
cat and dog-fleas occasionally bite human beings;
and cat-fleas are found on dogs and dog-fleas are
found on cats. All fleas, so far as we know, may
occasionally pass from one species of host to another;
but they do not, for the most part, seem to flourish
in unaccustomed quarters. Some fleas are more
catholic in their tastes than others. Some seem to
be very strictly confined to one host, and even when
starving only suck strange blood under protest.
There is a species of flea that has only (except by
accident) been found on the long-tailed field-mouse
and another that has only been found on the hedgehog.
Other fleas are commonly found on two absolutely
distinct animals; a good instance of this is the
human flea which, at all events in certain parts of
England, is a regular parasite of the badger.</p>

<p>As distinguished from true or natural hosts one
must separate what may be termed casual or accidental
hosts. All animals which come in contact
with one another, or which live in close proximity,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
may exchange fleas. So even bird-fleas may be
collected from mammals and typically mammalian
fleas from birds. In this fashion puzzles may arise
which tax the ingenuity of the collector to solve.
Bird-fleas are sometimes found on bats, and this may
be obviously attributed to the bats having inhabited
a hole which was tenanted by starlings or an old
loft infested with the fleas of pigeons. All beasts
of prey are sometimes found to harbour the fleas of
animals they have devoured. Rabbits’ fleas are
found on wild-cats; hedgehogs’ fleas on foxes; mice
fleas on weasels; and fleas characteristic of small
birds on stoats. So also in the case of mice, rats
and voles with holes and runs in the same hedgerow,
the parasites usually peculiar to one are not uncommonly
found on the others. It is sometimes difficult
to determine the true host of a flea.</p>

<p>Much more puzzling to explain are the reasons
which confine a flea to a certain host and which cause
closely allied hosts to have different fleas. The fleas
from the house-martin and the sand-martin are quite
different; those from the domestic fowl and the domestic
pigeon are distinct species. The causes which have
affected the evolution of the various forms of flea are
too obscure to enable anyone at the present day to
offer any satisfactory explanation.</p>

<p>Speaking generally, the fleas found on birds have
points in common, and they probably form a natural<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
group to themselves. What may be called true bird-fleas
have been collected from almost all European
birds. An unwieldy genus (<i>Ceratophyllus</i>) comprises
many species of different flea. Some species are very
abundant and infest the nests of many different birds.
Others are extremely rare. One of these rarities
(<i>C. vagabundus</i>) is found in the nests of puffins
and other sea-birds. Another has been collected on
antarctic petrels. Penguins have a special genus of
flea to themselves. A specimen, unique at one time
(<i>Ceratophyllus borealis</i>), in Mr N. C. Rothschild’s
collection was obtained from the gannet. It has now
been found on rock-pipits in the Shetland Islands.</p>

<p>Two very rare fleas (<i>C. farreni</i> and C. <i>rothschildi</i>)
are found in the nests of house-martins; yet
the nests of these birds are infested with common
species besides. A plague flea (<i>Xenopsylla</i>) has been
found on an African swift.</p>

<p>Forty-six different species of flea have been found
in the British Islands, but many of these are extremely
scarce.</p>

<p>We know too little about the geographical distribution
of fleas to lay down many accurate generalities.
When a great deal more material has been collected
and studied, it may be possible to show that certain
groups are associated with certain regions of the
earth or certain orders of animals. To some extent
this is already seen to be the case. The fleas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
indigenous to the New World are distantly related
to those of the Old World. Broadly speaking the
geographical distribution of the parasite must follow
that of the host. But sometimes the parasite is
impatient of cold and cannot follow the host out
of the tropics. The chigoes and their allies are fleas
of hot countries. Different kinds of bats are found
from the tropics to the Arctic circle, but the same
bat-fleas are not found everywhere.</p>

<p>When a flea has a cosmopolitan range it is
probable that it has travelled over the world in
company with its host.</p>

<p>Monkeys have no fleas. This is an assertion that
is commonly received with surprise and incredulity.
Occasionally a gorilla or a chimpanzee may get a
chigoe in its toe. And monkeys in zoological gardens
or menageries are possibly exposed to the danger
of catching an occasional human flea from the people
who crowd round their cages. These are remote
contingencies which may happen to anyone. Healthy
wild monkeys are much too clean and active to
harbour fleas. When they search one another’s fur
in a fashion that must be familiar to most persons,
they are clearing their coats of particles of scurf or
of similar scraps of dirt and not of fleas. So,
speaking generally, it may be said that no fleas have
been found truly parasitic on monkeys.</p>

<p>Bats have fleas, but not in great abundance. All<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
bat-fleas are rare on their hosts and extremely
difficult to find and collect. The same species are
not found on fruit-bats and the ordinary smaller
insect-eating bats. The geographical distribution of
some bat-fleas is puzzling. For instance, one species
(<i>Ischnopsylla unipectinata</i>) is found on the greater
horse-shoe bat in Europe; but it is, apparently, not
found on the same bat in the British Islands. In
Somaliland and in India it is found on other bats.</p>

<p>With certain exceptions, Ungulates are remarkably
free from fleas. This great order of mammals
includes a variety of hoofed animals: oxen, sheep,
goats, deer, pigs, camels, giraffes and antelopes.</p>

<p>The only true fleas found on these are two species of
the genus <i>Vermipsylla</i>, which resemble the chigoes in
so far that the pregnant females burrow into the host
and expand there. One species has been found on
camels and horses in Transcaucasia; another on roe-deer
in Northern China. The female of the last is
often found ensconced on the inside of the nostrils
of the deer. Of course chigoes may attack domestic
Ungulates of all kinds; but no other members of
the family <i>Pulicidæ</i> or typical fleas except those
two above mentioned have been found on hoofed
mammals.</p>

<p>Insectivora such as moles, shrews and hedgehogs
are the hosts of a great variety of species. The same
thing may be said of the Rodents, which include<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
porcupines, squirrels, rats, mice and a vast number
of other small mammals whose geographical distribution
includes almost the whole of the habitable
globe. Probably more different species of fleas have
been collected from Insectivora and Rodents than from
all the other orders of mammals grouped together.</p>

<p>The Carnivora, excluding the Pinnepedia, or seals,
sea-lions and walruses, harbour numerous species.</p>

<p>Among the Edentata a very remarkable and highly
specialised genus of fleas is parasitic on armadilloes
in South America. This genus (<i>Malacopsylla</i>) consists
of two species only, which are confined to South
America and are found on the armadilloes and on
carnivorous animals which probably have preyed on
them. The thorax of these fleas is much reduced
and very small in size. Their piercing organs are
slender and weak, but they possess enormous spines
on the legs with which they hold on to their hosts.
These two South American fleas (<i>M. grossiventris</i>
and <i>M. androcli</i>) will be referred to again later as
striking examples of fleas with strongly developed
legs and weakly constructed mouth-parts. The contrary
combination of powerful mouths and degenerate
legs is also found in other groups of fleas, as will be
seen in the chapter on the chigoes.</p>

<p>The Marsupials of Australia and South America
have special fleas which were probably associated
with this strange order of pouched mammals before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
they became divided into the American and Australian
groups. Fleas have been collected on the spiny ant-eater
(<i>Echidna</i>) which belongs to the lowest order
of Monotremes or egg-laying mammals.</p>

<p>On almost every form of bird, including the most
aquatic kinds, fleas of various species have been
obtained.</p>

<p>Only one instance has been recorded of a flea
occurring on a reptile. A female of one of the species
of burrowing chigoes (<i>Echidnophaga ambulans</i>) from
Australia was collected by Dr Woodward from the
Brown Snake (<i>Diemenia superciliosa</i>). This reptile,
which is well known in Australia, belongs to a sub-family
that contains some of the most deadly
poisonous snakes and is allied to the cobras. The
Brown Snake is a terrestrial snake, and one must
regard the presence of the flea on such a host as a
rare and chance occurrence. The snake was captured
at Herdman’s Lake, near Perth in West Australia.
The same species of flea has also been obtained from
the phalangers (<i>Trichosurus</i>) which live in the tops
of the Australian gum-trees; from the little terrestrial
and nocturnal rat kangaroos (<i>Bettongia</i>); and from the
banded ant-eater (<i>Myrmecobius</i>), another Australian
Marsupial. It is possible that the flea moved from
some small mammal which was being devoured by
the snake and managed to fix itself between the
scaly plates of the reptile.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>When fleas are hatched in a nest they have no
choice but to attach themselves to the young mammals
or birds. But even in that case they frequently
leave their hosts and do not for very long remain
stationary. Moreover, when a host dies and becomes
cold the fleas invariably leave their quarters, which
explains how it may happen that Carnivora get
infested with the fleas of their prey. This change
of hosts which is always occurring makes it impossible
to draw conclusions from material collected in zoological
gardens where many animals are herded
together. In menageries, too, the normal conditions
of breeding are absent. A German naturalist collected
2036 fleas from theatres, concert-halls, ball-rooms,
schools and barracks in the grand-duchy of Baden
and found that more than fifty per cent. were dog-fleas
(<i>Ctenocephalus canis</i>). What the proportion
may be in other parts of Europe we have no materials
from which to form a judgment. In zoological gardens
cat-fleas (<i>Ct. felis</i>) are generally numerous in most of
the cages.</p>

<p>It is, of course, well known to every zoologist that
species are not fixed or constant and that various
forms of mammal or of bird tend to show geographical
variations. When a long series of skins are laid out
on a table and carefully examined it is seldom that
those from the west of any great region cannot be
picked out and distinguished from those obtained in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
the east. So we also get northern and southern forms
of the same species varying slightly. These variations
are perceptible in many forms of insects, and zoologists
now describe these local races as subspecies and
designate them with trinomials. No one, however,
knows enough as yet about all the various forms
which are assumed by fleas to attempt, except in a
few instances, to do so in the case of these animals.</p>

<p>The study of Siphonaptera is still quite in its
infancy. We know little or nothing of the minute
geographical variation of fleas. That there is such
a thing can already be seen in a few species. In the
meantime the study of variation must be postponed
until collectors have amassed a more plentiful amount
of material; and it is best to treat all forms which
are to all appearance constantly different as being
specifically distinct until more is known about
variation.</p>

<p>Any classification of fleas that may now be
attempted can only be tentative. It will be enough
for present purposes if the reader will remember
that the Order Siphonaptera can be divided into
three groups or families: (1) the chigoes and their
allies, which are the most parasitic fleas (<i>Sarcopsyllidæ</i>);
(2) the typical fleas to which the majority
of species belong (<i>Pulicidæ</i>); and (3) the bat-fleas
(<i>Ceratopsyllidæ</i>), which have certain peculiarities that
will be described in a later chapter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>Of the antiquity of fleas, and of the period in
geological history when the order made its appearance,
little can be said. When it was thought that
fleas were confined, as parasites, to warm-blooded
mammals and birds, evolutionists were inclined to
say that the parasites could not have appeared before
their hosts. The discovery of a flea on a reptile
opened the vista of possibly enormous antiquity
stretching back to Permian or Carboniferous ages.
The fossil record is most meagre. If we reject as too
doubtful the supposed remains of a flea from the
lower Oligocene strata at Aix in Provence, only one
undoubted fossil has been discovered. Nor does it
seem certain that fleas are entirely restricted to
preying on vertebrates. Dr Dampf introduced a
number of common bird-fleas (<i>Ceratophyllus gallinæ</i>)
of both sexes to some hairy caterpillars. He observed
that several of the fleas buried their heads in the
hairy covering of the larvæ and remained some time
in the attitude of sucking blood. While this was
going on the victims made violent demonstrations of
annoyance and discomfort. He also observed that
a naked caterpillar was not attacked.</p>

<p>Mr Boden has also recorded how he found in a
seed-warehouse some peas that were being eaten by
two species of Lepidopterous larvæ. On bringing
these home and keeping them in a jar, he found
among them some small larvæ which ultimately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
turned into fleas, probably <i>Pulex irritans</i>. These
fleas, being confined without other food, were observed
to prey on the Lepidopterous larvæ and to feed freely
on their juices. The larvæ which were attacked by
fleas pined and died. The fluid from the stomach
of the fleas when they were crushed was transparent
and not red like vertebrate blood which often exudes
when a mammalian flea is pinched and cracked
open.</p>

<p>A French entomologist has also reported that
the numerous fleas which swarm in the dwelling-houses
of Corsica, for want of other nourishment
turn their attention to flies that may be incapable
of flight.</p>

<p>The only fossil remains of a flea that have, so far,
been discovered are a single insect in a piece of Baltic
amber of Oligocene age. Many organic remains have
been preserved in this fashion, but this is the first
mammalian parasite that has been found. The flea
is admirably protected by its semi-transparent surroundings,
and the most minute details of structure,
the arrangement of bristles on the body, and the
number of segments to the labial palpi can be discerned.
This unique object is in the collection of
Professor Klebs. The first point to note is that a
flea of this antiquity hardly differs from the existing
insects of the present day. It has been referred to
an existing genus (<i>Palæopsylla</i>) of which there are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
at least four species living. Three of these are parasites
of the mole, and the fourth is found on shrews.
There is good reason to suppose that the host of the
fossil was some insectivorous mammal. The early
specialisation of fleas is strikingly illustrated. This
insect is already adapted for life on some warm-blooded
animal. It has a thoracic comb, and its
mouth-parts are in all respects like those of a modern
flea. It belongs to a genus which is still commonly
distributed over Europe. When we consider how
remote are the chances that a mammalian flea should
first get embedded in amber and should, subsequently,
be detected and described by a naturalist, we may
well understand that the owner of the fossil asked,
though without success, £1200 for it.</p>

<p>The ordinary person regards fleas as a subject for
humour of an obvious and familiar kind. The utilitarian
despises a man who can cheerfully spend his
time in collecting fleas. Yet it seems probable
that a study of their forms and habits may be of
immediate benefit to the human race. The discovery
that fleas are connected with the spread of plague is
an instance of apparently unprofitable scientific labour
proving of direct advantage to mankind. An accurate
knowledge of the structure and habits of fleas is now
seen to be of importance to all who are engaged in
fighting one of the most dreaded infectious diseases.
When plague breaks out men of science now at once<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
turn their attention to the fleas. This is likely to
prove more directly efficacious than the mediæval
custom of marking the house with a red cross and
inscribing the legend, “God have mercy on us.”</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER II</h2>

<p class="pch">THE EXTERNAL STRUCTURE OF A FLEA</p>

<p><span class="beg">In</span> comparing the structure of a flea with that
of a man, or any other of the higher animals, it is
of the utmost importance to understand that the one
has an internal and the other an external skeleton.
In either case the skeleton serves as an attachment
for the muscles by which the animal moves itself.
Everyone is familiar with the external skeleton of a
lobster and can see for himself how the muscles are
attached. The structure of a flea, though so much
smaller, is somewhat similar, except that the skeleton
is composed of a horny substance known as <i>chitin</i>
instead of being calcified. The chitinous cuticle
entirely covers the flea, but it varies in hardness
and thickness on different parts of the body. The
epidermis, or true skin, lies immediately beneath.
On those parts of the body which are to the rear
of the head the chitin forms a series of plates or
shields which overlap one another somewhat like the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
tiles of a house. The segmented structure of a flea
is there most clearly seen; this we may suppose is
an inheritance from the segmented worms.</p>

<p>The chitin which forms the external skeleton of a
flea is secreted by an outer layer of cells on the
insect’s body. The deposit being thin at the joints,
and thick on the plates, which serve for protection,
the flea is encased in a suit of flexible armour. It
is made of a fairly solid and dense substance, but,
owing to the absence of carbonate and phosphate of
lime, is much lighter than the familiar external
skeleton of the lobster. Chitin is a very peculiar
and durable substance which resists boiling in acids
or alkalies. It is a structureless substance, in the
sense that it does not consist of cells. Though horny
in appearance it is, of course, in no sense true horn
like that of the nails, hoofs, claws, and horns of
vertebrates.</p>

<p>The different species of flea vary considerably in
size. Some are smaller than the familiar human
flea. Others are much larger. A very large flea
(<i>Hystrichopsylla talpæ</i>) is that found on the mole.
The largest known flea (<i>Dolichopsyllus stylosus</i>) is
found on small rodents in the United States where,
as we know, all things are on a bigger scale than in
the Old World. It is seven millimetres long.</p>

<p>The colour of the horny integument varies from
a pale or light yellow to a ruddy or dark brown.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
It is plentifully sprinkled over with spines, bristles,
or hairs, directed backwards so as not to impede
progress. The presence or absence, the arrangement
on the body, and the size of these serve,
along with other features, to distinguish different
species. They seem materially to help a flea in
those wriggles to escape with which we are all
familiar. The bristles are not always the same in
size and arrangement in the two sexes of the same
species of flea. As a rule the males are more bristly
than the females.</p>

<p>These appendages of the flea’s integument are
called by various writers either spines, bristles, or
hairs. There is, however, no real distinction in the
structure or nature of the appendages, and it is a
question of degree which name is most appropriate.</p>

<p>In distinguishing species, very little reliance can
be placed on the colour of the flea. An insect newly
emerged from the pupa is always lighter in colour;
and the difference between the appearance of an
empty stomach and a stomach gorged with red blood
is surprising.</p>

<p>The general external appearance of a typical flea
belonging to the main family <i>Pulicidæ</i> is fairly
familiar to most persons. This is well seen in the
figure of the oriental rat-flea. The body is compressed
or flattened from side to side, and this is a feature
which is extremely rare among insects. It doubtless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
enables the animal to glide with greater facility
through the hairs of its host. Like other insects, a
flea is readily divided into a head, a thorax, and an
abdomen. The head is rounded on the top and front
and shows no obvious trace of segmentation; but
what is known of the development of other insects
leads one to think that it must properly be regarded
as a number of segments closely fused together. On
the under side of the front part of the head is a
beak or proboscis for piercing and sucking, composed
of the mouth-parts, whose structure is worthy of
minute study. It will be best to examine them in
detail in a subsequent chapter.</p>

<p>Some fleas have eyes, others have none. The
common mouse-flea (<i>Leptopsylla musculi</i>) is blind.
The bat-fleas are also destitute of eyes. The nocturnal
habits of their hosts would render eyes of
little or no use. If eyes are present they are large
and placed on either side of the head. Each is a
simple eye or ocellus; the compound eyes, divided
into a great number of hexagonal facets, which are
characteristic of many insects, are never found in
fleas.</p>

<p>Nothing is known about the flea’s powers of
vision, but there is no reason to suppose that they
are at all acute. The eyes are marked with pigment.
Ocelli appear to be primitive types of insect eye
which are, perhaps, an inheritance from a wormlike<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
ancestor. Presumably all the fleas of long ago had
eyes and those that are now blind have lost their
organs of sight from disuse. In their simplest condition,
the eyes of the lower invertebrates only
enable the creature, so far as one can judge, to
distinguish light from darkness. Entomologists
believe that the power of vision of ocelli is probably
confined to very near objects and that this simple
form of eye is more useful in dark places than the
compound eyes. There is no reason for believing
that fleas can distinguish colours or can discern any
object which is more than a few inches away. It is
enough for their purpose to perceive from which
point light comes upon them and to make all despatch
to escape in the opposite direction.</p>

<p>In blind fleas there is often a spine where the
eye should be. In one species the spine is rudimentary
and there is some black pigment beneath it.
It is not impossible that this is the vestige of a once
functional eye. In one genus, however, the eye and
the spine are both present. Of the fleas belonging
to this genus one species is South American and the
other European. The latter (<i>Typhloceras poppei</i>)
is confined to the long-tailed field-mouse.</p>

<p>The organs by which fleas keep in touch with
the outward world, and with other fleas, are their
antennæ. All fleas have antennæ; but unlike those
of a moth, a beetle, or a grasshopper, each fits neatly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
into a groove at the side of the head and can be
protruded when desired. This is another adaptation
to enable the insect to creep swiftly through a forest
of hairs.</p>

     <div class="caption"><p class="pcap400">Fig. 2. Showing a type of (<i>a</i>) <i>genal</i> and (<i>b</i>) <i>thoracic</i> combs
of a flea, on the under part of the head and on the
thorax respectively. Analagous combs are found in
several other parasitic insects and on the abdominal
segments of certain fleas.</p>
</div></div>

<p>The combs which are found on the heads of many
fleas are organs of exceptional interest (<a href="#i26">Fig. 2</a>).
They are toothed and horny appendages, which are
connected with parasitic habits, for somewhat similar
combs are found on several unrelated groups of
parasitic insects, as, for instance, on parasitic beetles
(<i>Platypsyllus</i>) found on the beaver, on insects allied
to bed-bugs (<i>Polyctenes</i>) found on bats, and on wingless
flies (<i>Nycteribia</i>) which infest Egyptian and
South American bats. The majority of the <i>Pulicidæ</i>
have one or more combs with comparatively
long teeth. These combs reach their maximum<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
development in the bat-fleas which have no less
than eight. Some Australian and South American
fleas (<i>Stephanocircus</i>) have a helmet-like comb
extending all round their heads. These combs are
by some supposed to be of service in holding on to
the hairs of the host; and, if one may judge from
experiments made on live fleas in cotton wool, they
are also used in moving forwards through the fur.</p>

<p>All the chigoes (<i>Sarcopsyllidæ</i>) have a large
triangular post-oral process which is more or less
curved and probably prevents the flea slipping back
as it pushes forward. Bat-fleas (<i>Ceratopsyllidæ</i>)
have lobes or flaps placed two on each side of the
head, which may possibly serve an identical purpose,
but whether they do so is not known.</p>

<p>These combs may be divided into three groups
according to the part of the flea’s body on which
they are found. Those found on the head are called
genal combs and take the form shown in <a href="#i26">Fig. 2</a>.
There are also combs found on the thorax. The
fossil flea (<i>Palæopsylla klebsi</i>) described in the
previous chapter has one of these thoracic combs.
A certain number of fleas also have combs on the
abdominal segments.</p>

<p>There are really two types of toothed organs on
fleas to both of which the name of comb may be
given. One is composed of a sheet of chitin with a
number of slits and teeth and resembles a true comb.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
The other consists merely of a number of highly
chitinised bristles arranged in a row. They probably
both serve the same function. Apart from their use
as organs to assist movement onwards, they may also
serve as <i>hair-tight</i> joints and protect the flea from
the inconvenience of getting the tips of the host’s fur
into the joints of its horny armour.</p>

<p>The size of the head compared to the thorax and
abdomen varies considerably in different species.
Some fleas have what may be called by comparison
large heads and others very small ones.</p>

<p>A small head is never found in a flea with powerful
mouth-parts. The head being the bearer of piercing
and sucking organs, which require strong muscles,
there must be room not only for the organs but for
their extensors and retractors.</p>

<p>There are normally three rows of bristles on a
flea’s head which divide the head into four sections.
It is possible that these correspond to the four
segments of the ancestral insect which are now fused
together.</p>

<p>The head of a flea is closely applied by the whole
of its back surface to the body and that slender
and conspicuous neck which is characteristic of the
Diptera, or flies, is not to be found in any fleas.
For this reason a flea cannot turn its head in any
direction without at the same time following it round
with its body.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>The thorax of a flea consists of three segments
called respectively the prothorax, mesothorax and
metathorax. The chitinous external skeleton which
covers each of these three segments is primarily a
hoop but each hoop is further subdivided into a
number of complicated plates. Attached to the thorax
are the three pairs of legs which are characteristic of
all adult insects. The hind pair are very much the
strongest (<a href="#i30">Fig. 3</a>). They are the organs of hopping.
It has often been pointed out that if men had the
leaping powers of some fleas they would bound with
ease backwards and forwards over the cross on the
top of St. Paul’s Cathedral. Each leg consists of
four segments beautifully articulated and plentifully
supplied with bristles. At the end comes the foot
with five very short segments. The last segment
is provided with a pair of more or less formidable
claws. Fleas use their legs for leaping, for running,
and for clinging to their hosts. They also use their
mouth-parts for the last purpose and it is worthy of
note, as we shall see later on, that in those fleas in
which the mouth-parts are shortest and weakest the
legs are most liberally supplied with bristles and
possess the stoutest claws. The legs of a flea are
unique in the insect world owing to the enormous
development of the segment nearest the body called
the coxa. Most leaping insects rely for their activity
on the muscles of the lower joints. In a grasshopper
it is the third joint from the body (femur) which is
so immensely enlarged. The three pairs of legs are
each attached to a different thoracic segment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

     <div class="caption"><p class="pcap450">Fig. 3. The hind leg of a flea. The segment or joint nearest the
body is the <i>coxa</i> which is unusually developed. Next come the
small <i>trochanter</i> and the larger <i>femur</i>. The <i>tibia</i> which is long
and slender follows. Then come the five <i>tarsi</i> with the sixth
and ultimate segment provided with claws.</p>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>When fleas walk, they are so to speak plantigrades
walking on the sole of the foot, and all the
tarsal or foot joints are applied to the surface of
the ground. The claws serve as grips so as to make
the most of any unevenness; and thus the insect
drags itself along with surprising rapidity when it
moves through the hairy coat of a mammal. But
on an open surface fleas are not really rapid movers
compared with many other insects.</p>

<p>The two claws on the end of each ultimate foot
segment are freely moveable and are in fact highly
modified bristles or setæ.</p>

<p>In all fleas one of the plates of the metathorax
(or hindmost thoracic segment) called the epimeron,
is large and prolonged towards the rear. It invariably
bears a stigma. The epimeron is placed
laterally to the first abdominal tergite. The older
naturalists jumped to the conclusion that this was
the remains of a wing. The best judges have, however,
formed a decided opinion that no trace of the
relic of a flying organ can be detected on the thorax
of a flea. Heymons, a German entomologist, has
also failed to detect any sign in dissections which he
has made of the larvæ and the pupæ.</p>

<p>The epimeron is in fact neither a scale nor a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
wing but a portion of the thorax present in all
insects. It is of no special service to the flea except
as a portion of the thoracic armature which covers
the body.</p>

<p>The larva of a flea has no legs; the adult insect
has six. A study of other embryo insects shows that
the ancestors of insects had many legs. It is an
interesting problem why insects lost the legs on
their abdomens, why legs should now invariably be
restricted to the thorax, and why there should never
be more than three pairs. In the earliest known
insects which lived on the earth, before winged forms
were evolved, the number of legs was already six.
But our knowledge of fleas is too small to attempt, at
present, to trace their exact line of ancestral descent.</p>

<p>The abdomen of a flea consists of ten segments.
The horny plates which cover the dorsal side are
called tergites; those on the ventral side sternites.
In fleas, as in all holometabolous insects, that is
those which pass through a complete metamorphosis,
the sternite of the first abdominal segment is suppressed
and has completely disappeared. The tergite
which covers the dorsal part of the first abdominal
segment nearest to the thorax is, however, always
present.</p>

<p>The ultimate segments of the male and female
flea are modified for reproductive purposes and of
these segments more must be said later.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>Having now given a rough outline of the external
skeleton of a flea, it only remains to say something
about the muscular system. Attached to the inside
of the chitinous armature are an enormous number
of muscles, whitish and almost transparent. They
act as extensors, retractors, flexors, elevators and
depressors. The joints and hinges of the skeleton
allow of considerable, but not perfect, freedom. The
muscles of locomotion are partly in the thorax
and partly in the several joints of the legs. Our
knowledge of the muscular system of fleas is
very imperfect. But, as in other insects, the general
arrangement of the muscles is based on the
segmented structure of the body.</p>

<p>For the reader who can accurately picture to
himself the external structure of a flea and of the
typical insects belonging to other orders, a few words
may be said on the probable ancestry of fleas and
their relationship to other living insects. This vexed
and much debated question is still, as the older
naturalists would have said, <i>tremendum mysterium</i>.
Very little light has yet been thrown upon it, and
the most divergent views have been expressed by
learned and competent entomologists. A historic
survey of the various opinions that have been held
since the days of Linnæus would fill many pages; but
a short summary of the different orders to which fleas
have been referred by different zoologists will suffice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>The older authors, Linnæus, Geoffroy, Cuvier and
Duméril, and Gervais placed them among the <i>Aptera</i>
because they were wingless. Kircher regarded
them as <i>Orthoptera</i>, an order which includes grasshoppers
and crickets; but he has had few followers.
By Fabricius and by Illiger they were treated as
<i>Hemiptera</i> or bugs. Lameere, a Belgian, has
recently expressed a decided view that fleas are
really a family of <i>Coleoptera</i> or beetles. Those who
have held the once orthodox opinion that they
belonged to the <i>Diptera</i> or flies are Roesel, Oken,
Straus-Dürkheim, Burmeister, Newman, Walker, von
Siebold and Wagner.</p>

<p>The structure of an adult flea, however, differs
from that of an adult fly in the following noteworthy
respects: the mouth-parts are differently
constructed, the head of the flea is closely joined
to its thorax, the three divisions of the thorax
are not joined and fused, the flea is wingless, the
eyes of fleas are simple ocelli, and there are differences
of lesser importance in the stigmata, which
give access to the tracheal system by which all
insects breathe.</p>

<p>The number of those who have regarded fleas as
belonging to a distinct order of insects is considerable:
they are Lamarck, De Geer, Latreille, Kirby
and Spence, MacLeay, Leach, Dugès, Bouché, van
der Hoeven, Westwood, Landois, Brauer, Kraepelin,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
and Taschenberg. Modern opinion is all but unanimous
on this point.</p>

<p>There remains, however, a second question. Even
if it be agreed that there must be a distinct order
for <i>Suctoria, Aphaniptera, Siphonaptera</i>, or fleas;
where ought that order to be placed? In which
other order of insects must we look for the nearest
relations of fleas? For a time after the acceptance
of the fact that insect forms have been evolved, and
not separately created, the ancestors of fleas were
searched for among some species of fly.</p>

<p>Then Kraepelin rejected the view that flies were
as closely related to fleas as most entomologists
thought and his followers could only find points of
difference and no points of resemblance. Dahl (1899),
a German, then took up the cudgels for the fly
theory. Dahl pointed out the resemblance between
fleas and a group of flies called <i>Phoridæ</i> also
parasitic on warm-blooded animals. During the
ensuing years the debate was resumed afresh
with much liveliness and sometimes with a little
acrimony.</p>

<p>The fleas were placed by MacLeay and by
Balbiani between the <i>Diptera</i> and <i>Hemiptera</i>;
by Leach between the <i>Hemiptera</i> and <i>Lepidoptera</i>;
by Dugès between the <i>Hymenoptera</i> and <i>Diptera</i>;
by Brauer between the <i>Diptera</i> and <i>Coleoptera</i>.
Handlirsch thinks that fleas have no connection at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
all with beetles and Gross can find no signs of
relationship with either <i>Coleoptera</i> or <i>Diptera</i>.</p>

<p>Embryology and the study of larval forms have
thrown so much light on the ancestry of many
animals, that it was hoped that a microscopic
examination of the larvæ of fleas, in various stages
of development, would produce some facts of importance.
In this hope entomologists have, to a
great extent, been disappointed. There seems to
be much similarity between the embryos of beetles,
moths, flies, wasps and fleas. Those who have dwelt
on the likeness of the larval flea to the maggot of a
fly seem to forget that the resemblance to an embryo
beetle is nearly as strong.</p>

<p>The young larva of the flea is very transparent
and the digestive canal, heart and nervous system
are easily recognised. The egg-shell breaker is an
interesting example of the development of a temporary
larval structure and it is the only known
instance of such a structure in an insect. There
are no traces of eyes. The antennæ are three-jointed.
They are rather long and slender, being
about one-third as long as the head. The head is
well-developed and the larva has no feet.</p>

<p>The biting mandibles are broad and triangular.
Compared with those of other larvæ they are said
to be more like the mandibles of coleopterous than
of dipterous larvæ. The maxillæ, or second pair of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
jaws, are somewhat reduced and rudimentary. The
absence of eyes and of legs are points of similarity
between the larvæ of fleas and flies. The maggot
of a fly has also two pairs of jaws, and a pair of
antennæ.</p>

<p>At the tail end of the larval flea’s abdomen are
two small projections called caudal stylets (<a href="#i6">Fig. 1</a>).
They are strong, recurved, chitinous, structures which
prop up the body of the larva when it creeps and
wriggles. There are similar props in the larvæ of
certain beetles and no exactly similar organs are
known in dipterous larvæ. But caudal stylets are
of small taxonomic importance.</p>

<p>In one respect the mature flea is certainly nearer
to a beetle than to a fly: the three joints of the thorax
are free as in a beetle and not fused as in a fly;
but when one studies the mouth-parts, the true view
seems to be that the mouth-parts of a flea are
equally unlike those of a fly and those of a beetle.
Such being the present state of our knowledge, one
must wait for fresh light to be thrown on the matter
by further researches. It seems unlikely that the
immediate future will produce a solution of the
problem.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER III</h2>

<p class="pch">THE MOUTH-PARTS AND SENSE-ORGANS</p>

<p><span class="beg">When</span> the outward anatomy of a flea was described,
in an earlier chapter, the mouth-parts, which
form a sort of beak or proboscis under the head,
were mentioned. These most interesting parts of the
insect must now be dealt with. The reader probably
knows that some insects have mouths for sucking
fluids and others mouths for biting solids. A moth
or a fly cannot masticate solids, whilst a beetle or
a cricket has effective biting jaws.</p>

<p>The first naturalist who studied the mouth-parts
of a flea, with such microscopes as were then available,
was Leeuwenhoek. He was a Dutchman who
worked at the end of the seventeenth century, and
the minute accuracy of whose observations still often
fills modern naturalists with wonder. Microscopic
work was then in its early days, but Leeuwenhoek
clearly made out the two serrated lancets (<a href="#i43">Fig. 4</a>)
which are called the mandibles. His “Microscopical
observations on the structure of the proboscis of
a flea” were published in the <i>Transactions of the
Royal Society</i> in 1706.</p>

<p>The mouth-parts of fleas are differently constructed
from those of all other insects. Around the orifice
of the mouth are a number of appendages which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
form a complicated apparatus for piercing and
sucking. Their construction and use cannot be described
without employing some technical terms.
When the names of the parts have been mastered,
a diagram will make their relative positions clear.
It may be necessary, first, to remind the reader who
is not an entomologist that the real <i>mouth</i> of an
insect is the entrance to the alimentary canal, and
that the appendages of the mouth, which act like
jaws for masticating or like tubes for sucking, are
really modified limbs. In fleas the mouth is suctorial.
But before sucking up the blood the flea must first
pierce the skin of its host. The paired mouth-parts,
then, are modified limbs which correspond with those
appendages on the thorax of an insect which we call
the three pairs of legs.</p>

<p>The primitive insect, of which fleas and all other
insects are descendants, was, it is supposed, composed
of a succession of segments each bearing a pair of
jointed appendages. Insects of the present day never
have more than six legs, but the foremost pairs of
appendages have been bent round, reduced in size,
and altered in shape so as to serve as mouth-parts.</p>

<p>Now the mouth-parts of the flea for which only
technical names exist are the maxillæ and maxillary
palpi, the labium and labial palpi, the mandibles and
the labrum. The labrum is considered by some
authorities to be the hypopharynx. It will be best<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
to deal with each of these in turn and then to explain
how they act in combination.</p>

<p><i>The maxillæ.</i> These are a pair of horny or
chitinous triangular plates one on either side of the
flea’s face. They are placed some distance away from
the orifice of the mouth and to the right and left of
it. They do not serve for piercing or sucking, and
appear to have no active function unless they serve
to separate the hairs of the host and enable the flea
to reach the bare skin. In the majority of bat-fleas
(<i>Ceratopsyllidæ</i>) the maxillæ are dumb-bell-shaped
but in all other fleas they are more or less triangular.
From the fore part of each springs a palpus. Like
other highly chitinised parts of a flea, the maxillæ
are usually dark in colour.</p>

<p><i>The maxillary palpi.</i> These are jointed hairy
feelers which project forwards and were mistaken by
the older naturalists for antennæ. They spring from
the base of each of the maxillæ where these latter
organs are joined to the head of the flea. The palpi
are sense-organs as the number of sensitive hairs on
their surface indicates. The maxillary palpi of fleas
are always composed of four segments.</p>

<p><i>The labium and labial palpi.</i> These form together
what is called the <i>rostrum</i> of a flea. The
labium is a single organ which projects beneath the
aperture of the mouth. It may be described as the
lower lip of the flea. At its end it divides into two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
comparatively long branches. These are the labial
palpi. The actual piercing organs, which will be
described below, are the mandibles and labrum. They
are not so conspicuous as the rostrum which protects
them.</p>

<p>When the piercing organs are at rest they are
partly retracted. The external portion is encased in
the tubular rostrum. The tube is formed by the two
labial palpi which are situated at the apex of the
short non-divided labium. The number of segments
composing each labial palpus in fleas varies, so far as
we know, from two to seventeen. In most fleas,
however, the labial palpus consists of five segments.
This appears to have been the original state of things
in the ancestral flea; the palpus with more and the
palpus with less segments being derived from the
normal five-jointed one. The rostrum of a flea is
not a piercing organ like that of a fly and a bug.
The two labial palpi separate and lie flat, right and
left, on the skin when the true piercing organ is
driven into the host. The labial palpi therefore
require to be flexible, and this is attained by increasing
the number of segments or by reducing the
amount of chitinisation or horniness. We shall find
in the chigoes and their allies a rostrum which is pale,
weak, soft and scarcely horny. Among other fleas
where the rostrum is prolonged and strongly chitinised
we shall find greater segmentation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>The small bristles at the extreme tip of the
rostrum seem to be sensory organs. They are like
those at the apex of the maxillary palpus. When
a hungry flea is put on one’s arm, it appears to test
the skin with these bristles before it ventures to
make a puncture.</p>

<p><i>The mandibles.</i> These are a pair of sharp lancets
with serrated edges. They make the puncture and
are interlocked with the labrum to form a sucking
tube.</p>

<p><i>The labrum.</i> This is the central portion of the
mouth-parts and is in fact a prolongation of the
upper lip of the flea. It is a hard, sharp, awl-like
instrument: in shape like a horny trough. Its edges
are more or less toothed. Its apex is pointed and it
is as long as the mandibles.</p>

<p>The general appearance and the relative positions
of the mouth-parts are shown in <a href="#i43">Fig. 4</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

awl-like structure at the top is the <i>labrum</i>. Beneath
are the paired <i>mandibles</i> with serrated edges. The
four-jointed hairy <i>maxillary palpus</i> is below, only one
being shown. Protruding from the base of the face is
the <i>labium</i> which supports the jointed <i>labial palpi</i>. The
flat obtuse triangular structure from which the palpus
springs is the right-hand <i>maxilla</i>. The left maxilla is
concealed behind.</p>
</div></div>

<p>Bearing in mind, then, that the piercing organs
are the labrum and the two mandibles, and that the
rostrum (composed of labium and labial palpi) is
merely a sheath, it is easy to form a clear picture of
a flea feeding. Anyone who is bold enough to place
a hungry flea on the bare skin of the arm can readily
observe through a powerful lens what happens.
When the flea has chosen a spot to pierce the skin,
the rostrum, with the mandibles and long upper lip
or labrum inside it, is moved a little forward. The
flea then lifts its abdomen upwards and presses the
piercing organs down into the skin. In doing this,
it uses its own weight and the strength of the foremost
and middle pairs of legs. The hind pair of legs
are lifted up into the air. The head can soon be
seen coming nearer the skin. The rostrum then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
divides in the middle. The labial palpi are forced
apart as the mandibles and labrum penetrate into
the victim’s flesh. Finally, they are driven entirely
asunder and lie flat on the skin of the host, one to
the right and the other to the left. The flea then
satisfies its hunger. A stream of blood is sucked up,
and when the meal is over, there is a forcible action
of the legs and the mandibles and upper lip are
withdrawn with a jerk. Numerous observers have
remarked on the habit possessed by fleas of discharging
the contents of their intestines whilst actually
engaged in sucking. In many cases a drop of bright
red blood is squirted from the rectum during the
operation of feeding, and this appears to be a common
practice among blood-sucking insects. Its bearing on
the feeding operation of the flea has not been discovered.
But its possible consequences in transmitting
diseases from host to host will be seen in
a subsequent chapter on fleas and the transmission
of plague.</p>

<p>It is said that the nervous systems and brains of
fleas are not so highly developed as those of many
other insects such, for instance, as ants, bees and
other Hymenoptera. Having drawn attention to the
distinction between the external skeleton of a flea
and the internal skeleton of a vertebrate, one may
with profit do the same in the case of their nervous
systems. In both cases the nervous system serves to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
convey sensations from the sense-organs, and movements
to the muscles. In the vertebrate, as the
reader doubtless knows, there is a brain, a nervous
cord running from it down the backbone, and a
number of nerves issuing, from the spinal cord and
from the brain, in various directions. Here the main
nervous system runs down the <i>back</i> of the animal.
In a flea, or other insect, the nervous system consists
of a chain of ganglia connected by a nervous cord.
A ganglion is a nerve centre and, in a sense, each
is a brain which may be likened to the one brain of
the vertebrate. We have in the cord of ganglia
a series of brains, as it were, running from the head
down to the extremity of the abdomen. Each ganglion
is a mass of nerve cells, from each of which a fibre
passes off to unite with the other fibres and make
a nerve. The first ganglion in a flea is placed in the
upper part of the head above the gullet. It may be
called the brain since it receives the nerves of the
antennæ and eyes. In the ancestral insect we may
suppose that there was a pair of ganglia in each
segment. Since the head of the flea consists of
several fused segments, we may fairly draw the
conclusion that the brain is the result of the fusion
of several pairs of ganglia.</p>

<p>The brain of the insect occupies the same position
in the body as the brain of the vertebrate; but the
rest of the nervous system lies on the floor of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
body <i>under</i> the digestive canal of the flea, whereas in
the vertebrate it lies along the back and <i>above</i> the
digestive canal. The dorsal spinal cord of the vertebrate
is then a ventral nervous cord in a flea.</p>

<p>The sensory nerves, which transmit sensations
from different sense-organs, and the motor nerves,
which send stimuli to the muscles, take their origin
from other ganglia besides the ganglion above the
gullet. In bees and some other insects it has been
shown that the nerves from the palpi and mouth-parts
go to the next ganglion which is beneath the
gullet. The same is probably the case with fleas; so
when we speak of the <i>brain</i> of a flea we must remember
that it has a relative rather than an absolute
claim to that title. A flea has really many brains.</p>

<p>In certain blind insects, where the eyes are
wanting, parts of the brain are completely atrophied.
Whether this is so in the blind species of fleas does
not seem to have been investigated.</p>

     <div class="caption"><p class="pcap450">Fig. 5. The antenna of a flea. A, concealed in the groove. B, protruded
from the head. The versatile <i>basal segments</i> and the
terminal <i>club</i>, in this case with segments on one side of it,
should be noticed.</p>
</div></div>

<p>We pass now from the central nervous system to
the sense-organs of the flea. The chief are the eyes,
the antennæ and the pygidium. In regard to the
eyes nothing more need be said. The antennæ are
probably far more important organs to a flea than its
eyes; but inasmuch as they are at ordinary times
concealed in a groove they are not very conspicuous
(<a href="#i47">Fig. 5</a>). The first tolerably accurate plate of a flea
by a naturalist will be found in Hooke’s <i>Micrographia</i>
(1664). Robert Hooke (1635-1703) was a somewhat
eccentric and irritable man of science who acted as
secretary to the Royal Society. His labours were too
varied to be effective. He nearly discovered the laws
of gravity and also studied fleas. To him belongs
the credit of having detected the antennæ groove.
Just as many of the older naturalists thought that
the maxillary palpi were antennæ, so others thought
that the antennæ of a flea were its ears. And when,
with the help of their lenses, they saw the antennæ
erected and protruded from their grooves, they
imagined that the insect was cocking its ears and
listening after the manner of a horse or ass. But
the antennæ of fleas are much more to them than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
ears; though it may be that they are also auditory
organs. They are certainly tactile and olfactory
organs as well. In outward structure each antenna
consists of two parts which may be called the stalk
and the club. The club is divided into a number of
segments and is plentifully supplied with hairs. In
some species the cuts which divide the different
segments appear to be confined to one side of the
club. In others a sort of central core holds the
segments of the club together. The antennæ, therefore,
are undoubtedly exceedingly complex organs.
Such an insect as a flea may well be far more sensitive
to movements of the air, vibrations of the earth,
smells, light rays and sound-waves than a human
being. In their origin the antennæ, like the paired
mouth-parts, are modified appendages of the fused
segments which compose the head of the insect. The
fact that there are four pairs of appendages on the
insect’s head, viz. (1) antennæ, (2) maxillæ, (3) labial
palpi and (4) mandibles has been put forward by
some entomologists as evidence that the head is
formed of four primary segments.</p>

<p>Antennæ apparently enable fleas to find their
bearings, to communicate with one another and to
discover the whereabouts of the opposite sex. But
it is especially as organs of smell that they play
a most important part in the flea’s social life. They
enable couples to find one another; and, when the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
sexes come together, the antennæ of the male are
usually raised and exposed from the groove. Insects
generally have some means of cleansing dirt from
their antennæ. Some make use of their legs, others
of their mouth-parts. In fleas there is often a row of
short hairs at the hind margin of the groove which
may serve as a kind of comb for cleaning these
delicate organs of sense. But further observation on
this point would be interesting, for no one appears to
have seen the comb in actual use. Female fleas are
said usually to carry their antennæ ensconced in the
grooves, whilst the males more frequently protrude
theirs. The antennæ of the males are generally
longer than those of the females.</p>

<p>There are certain noteworthy organs of sense
which appear to exist on the upper surface of a flea’s
head and body. They take the form of small convexities
of the body surface, lentil-shaped and each
surrounded at the base by a ring. Somewhat similar
sense-organs are widely spread through the insect
world. As to their function, divergent views are
held. Some think that they are for the perception
of sounds, some for the perception of light rays, some
for the perception of rays of which we are unconscious.
Since these organs are placed, at times,
in unprominent parts of the body it seems more
probable that they are affected by sound than by
light.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>The preference which fleas show for certain animals,
and the repulsion which they manifest on being allowed
to suck blood from an unaccustomed host, lead one
to believe that they have a sense of taste. This sense
in other insects is apparently seated in certain microscopic
pits and hairs which form the ends of nerves
and are distributed round the mouth. Whether fleas
can hear is not, it seems, definitely known.</p>

<p>A large number of fleas possess what is called
a frontal tubercle. It is a notch in the centre of the
forehead but nearer to the mouth than to the antenna.
Sometimes the tubercle projects from a groove. This
is most marked in the genus of African fleas <i>Listropsylla</i>.
The real nature of this organ is unknown.
Some regard it as an organ of sense. Its homology
is also uncertain. To some it suggests the egg-breaker
of the larva and they regard it as a relic of
the larval stage. To others it suggests an eye and
they regard it as the remnant of an unpaired ocellus
possessed by the ancestral flea.</p>

<p>An exceedingly remarkable organ of sense, which
is found in all fleas, is called the pygidium. It is
a sensory-plate plentifully supplied with hairs and
nerves and always placed on the back of the ninth
abdominal segment. Of all its uses we are still somewhat
uncertain but some observers declare that at
the season of love the male flea bestows caresses on
the pygidium of the female.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>In many species the male flea is sufficiently
different in outward appearance from the female to
be easily distinguished. The male is usually smaller
and the last segments of the abdomen are so shaped
as to give the look of a tail tilted into the air. The
frontispiece represents a male flea and shows this
well. The internal organs of reproduction (testes
and ovaries) in the male and female are placed near
the end of the abdomen. The seminal outlet and
common oviduct open to the rear of the sensory
plate on the ninth segment of the abdomen. The
external genital armature of the male flea is exceedingly
complicated and quite unlike that of any
other insect. When the sexes are united, the usual
position is reversed, and the male is <i>beneath</i> the
female.</p>

<p>It is well known to every entomologist that the
hinder segments of insects are often modified for
reproductive purposes. In male fleas it is the eighth
and ninth abdominal segments which are altered. In
the females the eighth, and also often a portion of
the seventh, has assumed a peculiar shape. The
clasping organs of the male flea are portions of the
ninth segment and form together a kind of claw
reminding one of the pinchers of a lobster. It is
used by the male flea in the breeding season to detain
and hold the female.</p>

<p>Every entomologist also knows that the external<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
sexual organs of insects, of both sexes, are of special
importance to the systematist or classifying naturalist.
They often enable him to recognise the species when
other organs do not show sufficiently striking characters.
A minute study of the genitalia of fleas is
an absolute necessity to the systematic entomologist,
the more so as fleas do not present nearly as many,
or nearly as varied, external differences as do the
species of most winged insects where colour and
pattern of wings are both important.</p>

<p class="pch">THE INTERNAL ORGANS OF A FLEA</p>

<p><span class="beg">A flea</span> like every other animal must feed and
breathe, which leads to a consideration of the internal
organs of digestion and respiration. The digestive
canal is a slender tube which connects the mouth
and the anus, and which is less convoluted and much
straighter than in the higher vertebrates. <a href="#i53">Fig. 6</a>
will show the relative positions of the various parts,
namely, the mouth, pharynx, gullet, gizzard, stomach,
and rectum. Connected with the digestive canal are
certain glands and organs of excretion. The alimentary
tube itself passes through the middle of the
flea’s body, and is kept in that position partly by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
muscles and partly by the numerous branching air-tubes
through which the insect breathes. Above it
lies the heart, and beneath it the nervous cord or
chain of ganglia.</p>

<p class="vh"><a name="i53" id="i53">i53</a></p>

<div class="figcenter">

     <div class="caption"><p class="pcap400">Fig. 6. Diagram of the alimentary canal of a flea. At the
top is shown the orifice of the <i>mouth</i>, leading into the
<i>pharynx</i>. Next comes the short <i>gullet</i>. The <i>gizzard</i> is
the smaller organ immediately before the stomach. At
the base of the <i>stomach</i> are four vermiform tubes, which
are the <i>Malpighian tubules</i>. From the base of the
stomach issues the <i>intestine</i>, which leads to the <i>rectum</i>,
where the six <i>rectal glands</i> are shown.</p>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>The mouth of a flea, as of any other insect, is
merely an orifice which forms the opening into the
alimentary canal. Around the orifice are the various
mouth-parts which convey blood to the mouth, but
these, the reader will doubtless remember, are the
modified limbs or appendages of the segments that
compose the flea’s head. The mouth, then, gives
access to the digestive canal. The first part nearest
the mouth is the pharynx which merges gradually
into the gullet. Here is placed the pharyngeal pump
which is provided with a sucking apparatus. Muscles
attached to the dorsal part of the so-called aspiratory
pharynx cause it to expand and contract, owing to
the elastic reaction of its walls. The operating
muscles, which do this, are in the head of the flea.
When these pharyngeal muscles contract and relax
in regular sequence, a rhythmic action of the pharynx
itself ensues and a steady stream of blood is forced
or drawn from the mouth stomachwards. In a light
coloured flea, under a powerful lens, this action may
be watched in the living insect.</p>

<p>Behind the pharynx comes the gullet, which leads
down to the gizzard. It is perhaps needless to add
that this organ, neither in appearance nor in use,
bears any resemblance to the gizzard of a bird, which
grinds hard food. The food of the adult flea consists
solely of liquid blood.</p>

<p>The organ called <i>gizzard</i> in the flea, for want of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
better name, is, however, remarkable. Its function is
not quite certainly known. It is a bulbous expansion
in the front of the stomach and situated at the junction
of the stomach and the gullet. It contains a
multitude of chitinous finger-like processes tapering
towards their extremities. From their general
arrangement the complete collection of processes
would act as an effective sort of valve and prevent
the return of the fluids from the stomach. It seems
most probable that this is their function. During
the life of the flea the stomach is constantly churning
its contents. Some valvular arrangement between
the stomach and the pharynx would seem to be
essential; the pharynx is normally collapsed, as the
reader may remember, and its walls are drawn apart
by muscles attached to its exterior. When the
pharynx is full of blood the muscles relax, the walls
collapse like elastic, and the blood is forced into the
stomach. In many cases a flea will feed when the
stomach is already tensely full of blood; and some
sort of valve is therefore needed to prevent regurgitation
into the pharynx when the pharyngeal muscles
contract and the walls of the pharynx itself are drawn
asunder.</p>

<p>This valvular arrangement at the anterior end of
the flea’s stomach has been minutely studied in connection
with recent plague investigations, because
there was a theory that fleas carried infection by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
vomiting the septicæmic blood from their stomachs
and so transferred the plague bacillus to the puncture
which they made in the skin.</p>

<p>But an experiment, which has been tried several
times, seems to show that the supposed valve is
effective. The stomach of a flea which had recently
fed was dissected out intact. As long a portion of
rectum as possible was left attached at the hinder
end. The gullet having been severed, well in front
of the valve, pressure was applied with a blunt tool
with the object of forcing the blood through the
gullet. The hind aperture of the stomach was, at
the same time, closed by pinching up the rectum.
The result was that, in no instance, was it possible
to force blood through the passage which leads into
the gullet. Yet sufficient pressure was applied to
burst the stomach.</p>

<p>The stomach of a flea is a pear-shaped sack which
occupies an appreciable part of the insect’s abdomen.
That it is capable of containing a comparatively large
amount of blood is apparent from the observation
that after a flea has enjoyed a good meal nearly the
whole of the abdomen is seen to be filled with a bright
red mass. During the investigation of the part played
by fleas in spreading plague an endeavour was made
to measure, as accurately as possible, the average
capacity of a rat-flea’s stomach when filled with blood.
Healthy fleas, taken from Bombay rats, were starved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
for twelve hours, and at the end of that time were
fed on healthy animals. The stomach was then dissected
out whole and floated in a salt solution. Any
adherent organs or muscles were carefully removed.
Under these conditions the stomach can be examined
and measured under the microscope. The average
capacity of a rat-flea’s stomach has been approximately
estimated to be half a cubic millimetre.</p>

<p>The stomach of a flea is therefore, comparatively
speaking, very large. The blood remains in the
stomach in a partially digested condition. It gradually
diminishes in volume, showing clearly that
absorption is taking place. At the end of so much
of the digestive process as takes place in the flea’s
stomach, the blood has become reduced to a thick,
slimy, dark red mass. This passes down the intestine
to the rectum, where it is perhaps further influenced
by the secretion of the so-called rectal glands.
Finally, the undigested remains pass from the rectum
in the form of very minute, round, almost black, tarry
drops.</p>

<p>The terminal section of the flea’s digestive canal
is called the rectum. Here are placed the rectal
glands (<a href="#i53">Fig. 6</a>), which are six in number. Their
function seems not to be certainly known.</p>

<p>The external opening of the rectum is placed at
the extreme end of the flea’s body between the
tergite and sternite of the tenth segment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>We pass now to a couple of quite distinct
appendages of the digestive canal, namely the salivary
glands and the urinary tubules. In fleas the
salivary glands are four in number. Two are placed
on each side of the anterior end of the flea’s stomach.
Each is a simple acinous gland embedded in the body
and lined with cells which secrete the saliva. The
four ducts from the pairs of glands unite to form two
ducts; and the two ducts thus formed run forward
and open into the salivary pump. A spiral chitinous
membrane lines the inside of the ducts, keeps them
distended, and gives them somewhat the appearance
of tracheal tubes. The salivary pump is placed quite
in the front part of the insect’s head, and is an organ
worthy of special notice. It receives the saliva from
the glands by means of the two salivary ducts which
have just been described, and propels it through the
exit duct of the pump into the salivary canal in the
mandibles. The pump itself is a hollow chitinous
organ. Muscles attached to the walls alternately
contract and relax, drawing up the salivary secretion
and expelling it through the exit-duct. The opening
of the exit-duct is adjusted so as to be opposite to the
canals which extend down the mandibles like troughs.</p>

<p>It would seem that when the flea is feeding,
saliva is pumped into the puncture and blood is
pumped out. There is, as it were, an effluent and
an affluent stream passing along the mouth parts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>The urinary tubules are excretory organs which
carry off, in solution, the waste products of the flea’s
body. They are sometimes also called Malpighian
tubes (<a href="#i53">Fig. 6</a>). This name they received after
Malpighi (1628-94), a famous Italian anatomist, who,
four years after Harvey’s death, saw with his own
eyes the capillary circulation of which Harvey had
only inferred the existence. He also was the
first to detect the urinary tubes of insects. These
tubules answer to the kidneys of the higher vertebrate.
They vary in number in different insects from
two to over a hundred. In fleas there are four. They
are longish, slender, tubular glands which are closed
at one end, but, at the other, open into the rectum.
The urinary excretions come from the blood, pass
down the tubes into the rectum, and so leave the
flea’s body by the anus. In insects the urinary
excretion is, generally, only partially liquid.</p>

<p>The organs of respiration in a flea consist of a
series of tracheæ, or air-tubes, which open by apertures,
called stigmata, at the sides of the body. These
air-tubes branch and form an elaborate system of
ramifications. They have a horny lining and are
supported by a spirally-wound thread-like thickening.
In this way air is conveyed from the external world,
and the oxygen, which vital processes require, is
conducted to all parts of the insect’s body.</p>

<p>The blood-system of a flea is far less complete<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
than that of the lowest vertebrate. The blood is
almost colourless. A large contractile heart drives
it into the main blood-vessel. There is, however, no
closed system of arteries, capillaries, and veins such
as the higher animals possess; and the blood circulates
in the whole cavity which intervenes between
the body-wall and the various internal organs. There
is little need for an elaborate system of blood-vessels
since the internal tissues are supplied with oxygen
by the ramifying air-tubes. Fleas have more of the
air-holes called stigmata than any other insects.
Each of the three segments of the thorax has a pair,
as well as the second to the eighth segments of the
abdomen. The spiracles or apertures lie free on the
outside of the body. In beetles, and other insects
which run through dusty places, they are lodged in
the thin membrane between the segments.</p>

<p>The heart of a flea is a very delicate pulsating
tube which lies along the back, above the digestive
canal and immediately beneath the integument. One
may attribute some of the extraordinary strength
and vital energy of a flea to the fact that, by the
blood-system and the air-system, the tissues of the
body are kept richly supplied with oxygen. The
blood of a flea is a thin fluid and, of course, without
red corpuscles. The blood that is shed when a flea
is crushed comes from the stomach and not from the
blood-vessels of the insect.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>The internal organs of fleas cannot be studied
without dissection under a microscope. Dissection
is best carried on in a solution of salt and water.
Fine needles mounted in penholders are the most
handy implements. But the point of even the finest
commercial needle that can be bought is too blunt
for fine dissections, and it is necessary to sharpen it.
This can be done by the help of a rapidly revolving
emery wheel, varying the inclination of the needle-point
to the wheel, so as to grind off the angles. The
flea to be dissected is put in a drop of salt solution,
on a slide placed on the stage of the dissecting microscope.
In the left hand should be a needle with a
blunt conical point, in the right a needle with an
oblique point. The antennary groove of the flea
should then be transfixed and held firmly by the
left-hand needle.</p>

<p>The point of the right-hand needle is then inserted
under the edge of the third or fourth abdominal segments.
The segments can then be peeled off by a
skilful dissector much as we peel off the skin of a
shrimp for our tea at the sea-side. The internal
organs of the flea then float off in the salt solution;
and by using two very fine pointed needles they can
be further separated. It is useful to have one needle
ready with a hooked end and another fashioned into
a minute knife or scalpel.</p>

<p>The most conspicuous of the internal organs will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
be the stomach and intestine. The salivary glands
will be found at the side of the stomach with a certain
amount of fat round them. Their extraction is not
so difficult as might be supposed. The hooked needle
can be used to hook the salivary duct.</p>

<p>The most difficult parts to dissect are the organs
connected with the mouth and rostrum. It is best
to remove the head and transfix it with the left-hand
needle, then to scalp the head by removing the dorsal
half of the chitinous carapace. A bold plunge with
the right-hand needle will sometimes effect what is
desired. A pull on the labium will sometimes bring
out the pharynx. It must be confessed that successful
dissections are often obtained more by good luck
than by skilful management. The use of dilute potash
solution facilitates the study of chitinous parts by
jellifying the muscles.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER V</h2>

<p class="pch">THE HUMAN FLEA AND OTHER SPECIES</p>

<p><span class="beg">The</span> human flea (<i>Pulex irritans</i>) appears to
occupy an isolated position. The genus <i>Pulex</i> which
Linnæus established has now been reduced until it
contains one species only. The human flea belongs
to the group with eyes and without combs. In some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
respects it is the most specialized of all the <i>Pulicidæ</i>.
The chigoes (<i>Sarcopsyllidæ</i>) resemble it and are
doubtless derived from the <i>Pulicidæ</i>. The chief
structural character of this interesting insect is the
greatly reduced thorax. But it can be distinguished
from any other known flea by the fact that the
upper segment of the hind leg (hind coxa) bears a
number of hairs on the inner surface of the posterior
portion. A more noteworthy feature in this flea
is the presence, in a large proportion of specimens
of both sexes, of a small tooth at the edge of the
head. This small tooth is sometimes absent; but, when
present, both its position and its structure indicate
that it corresponds to the fifth tooth in the head
comb of the dog-flea (<i>Ctenocephalus canis</i>) (<a href="#i71">Fig. 7</a>). In
the hedgehog-flea (<i>Ct. erinacei</i>) the teeth of the combs
both on the head and on the thorax are small in size
and few in number. Occasionally they almost disappear.
The conclusion seems justified that the
human flea is descended from an ancestral form with
combs. To discuss whether the combs became useless
and were lost when the host lost the hairy covering
of its body would lead into regions of vague speculation
and occupy time unprofitably.</p>

<p>The nearest allies of the human flea, which are
found on various animals, are all inhabitants of the
Old World. The indigenous fleas of America are
only distant relatives of <i>Pulex irritans</i>. Our knowledge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
of the present and former distribution of this
species is deplorably meagre. The many books of
travel published in the early part of the nineteenth
century contain hardly any records of fleas. The
human flea is now cosmopolitan. Specimens identical
with those from Europe are found almost everywhere.
But it may be doubted whether this was the case
before the great era of travel and steam began in
last century.</p>

<p>There is one strange and, indeed, inexplicable fact
in connection with the distribution of this cosmopolitan
species of flea. It is absent from the oases of
the Sahara and the Haussa countries immediately to
the south of the great desert. These countries have
long been in communication with places where <i>Pulex
irritans</i> is known to abound. There is no natural
barrier. The habits of the natives would encourage
fleas to thrive, and other forms of human vermin are
plentiful. There is, apparently, only one explanation
that is forthcoming. It is suggested that the soil
and climate in these regions of Africa are, for some
reason, unsuited to fleas. In other parts of the Dark
Continent, where there are European settlements, the
human flea seems to thrive surprisingly well and
to attack Europeans and natives, as well as wild
and domestic animals. In those parts of Asia where
there are European colonies and much intercourse
between settlers and Orientals, <i>Pulex irritans</i> is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
well-established and thriving parasite. Unfortunately,
there is no means of knowing whether this was the
case among the native populations before European
travellers and traders arrived. <i>Pulex irritans</i> has,
however, recently been found on the natives of
German New Guinea living some 10,000 feet above
sea-level and in great isolation. Seaports are everywhere
infested with fleas.</p>

<p>Another problem on which no light has been
thrown concerns the evolution of the human flea.
It would be of great interest to know whether the
present species has undergone modifications of form
since it became a parasite of the human race; whether
we inherited the species from our simian ancestors;
or whether the flea of one of the lower mammals
became parasitic on mankind. In the Old World
this flea is essentially a parasite of man. It occurs
only occasionally on other mammals. In America
it certainly appears to occur more frequently on
mammals, other than man, than it does in the Old
World. Human fleas can propagate in deserted
human dwellings. The larvæ find nourishment in
any refuse that has been left behind, and the adult
insect can apparently continue for some time to
reproduce itself without a meal of any sort and
certainly without human blood. Travellers in the
East and in Africa have described how on entering
huts in deserted villages they have found their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
clothing covered with myriads of fleas, sometimes
ravenous, and at others weak from long fasting.</p>

<p>The human flea is a good deal more select in the
choice of a host than some other species. The cat-flea
(<i>Ctenocephalus felis</i>) has been found not only
on the cat, but also on the dog, tiger, leopard, goat,
horse, rat, hedgehog, kangaroo, deer, guinea-pig,
rabbit, and on man. Many of these were specimens
collected in zoological gardens. Although when
hungry and confined in a test-tube the human flea
will readily bite a rat or a guinea-pig, it has been
found that human fleas kept with no other food-supply
than rats and guinea-pigs soon die off.</p>

<p>When large numbers of human fleas were wanted
for experiments in Bombay, guinea-pigs were used as
traps to attract them. On one occasion two guinea-pigs
placed in a house which had been vacant for
some days, and in which fleas must have been short
of food, failed to attract any of this species; while a
man who entered the house shortly afterwards acted
as an admirable trap. Those who have not had
experience of the abundance and voracity of fleas
in oriental countries can hardly believe the numbers
of human fleas that may be captured by sending a
bare-legged man into a deserted house and then
picking the fleas off him. In one house 31 <i>P. irritans</i>
were taken on a man’s legs in a few minutes.
In another house 84 <i>P. irritans</i>, 8 cat-fleas and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
1 bird-flea were caught. In a third, 150 <i>P. irritans</i>
and 4 cat-fleas were captured in a short time.</p>

<p>The piercing organs of the human flea are strong
and well developed. This is rare in a flea which, far
from having adopted stationary habits, is a very active
insect. It has been suggested, with some show of
probability, that the wide and strongly serrated
mandibles were acquired after man became the
host. The naked skin and rough garment of mankind
would render the claws and legs of the flea
insufficient to keep the insect in a steady position
when feeding. Natural selection would, in due course,
strengthen the mouth organs.</p>

<p>The division of mankind into different races, many
of which are quite as distinct as the various species
of some genus among other animals, leads one to
expect various races among the fleas which are
parasitic on them. If the sand-martin and the
house-martin, the rat and the mouse have distinguishable
fleas, one might suppose that the
Caucasian and the Hottentot, the Australian native
and the Red Indian would follow suit. It may be
that further study will show that the human flea now
consists of a number of different races. In only one
case, however, does a development of this kind in
fact appear. Fleas taken off Mexican Indians show
slight but fairly constant differences from the true
<i>Pulex irritans</i>. The specimens are smaller in size,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
the rostrum is longer and the clasper of the male is
more pointed. If the Mexican Indians have a special
race of human flea it must have developed after the
Indians came to America, or they must have brought
it with them when they came. In the latter case this
race of flea may still exist in the country whence
these Indians originally came.</p>

<p>Apart from this apparently constant race, the
individual variation in specimens of the human flea
is slight. If a large series of mounted specimens are
examined with the microscope, it will be noticed that
the bristles or spines on the legs are sometimes more
or less numerous. But, with this exception, marked
varieties such as are frequently found among other
insects seem to be rare.</p>

<p>Although mankind is the true host of this flea, it
has been obtained in various parts of the world on
various mammals and occasionally on birds. But in
England, and probably in other parts of Europe as
well, <i>Pulex irritans</i> is an undoubted parasite of the
badger. A good series of the insect has been got
from wild badgers freshly captured near Reading in
Berkshire and Hastings in Sussex. In other parts of
the world it has been obtained from a variety of small
carnivora: cats, dogs, foxes, jackals and polecats. It
has also been found on Rodents (<i>Gerbillus</i>) and on
Insectivora (<i>Erinaceus</i>). In South Africa it has been
taken off a caracal and in North America off a lynx.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>Sandy places such as sea-beaches and picnic
grounds, where humanity congregates for pleasure
or business, frequently swarm with this species of
flea waiting an opportunity to feed. The larvæ are
bred in the sand and feed on organic refuse.</p>

<p>The genus most closely allied to that which contains
the human flea consists also of a single species
only. It is a large flea (<i>Pariodontis riggenbachi</i>)
found on porcupines all over Africa and in India.</p>

<p>Mankind is, occasionally, bitten by a variety of
other species besides <i>Pulex irritans</i>. In hot countries
the chigoe (<i>Dermatophilus penetrans</i>) is a serious and
troublesome pest, particularly to bare-footed people.
In temperate regions there are rat-fleas, cat-fleas,
dog-fleas and bird-fleas which occasionally transfer
themselves to man and feast on his blood. But, on
the whole, hunger and propinquity rather than free
inclination seem to actuate these fleas of which man
is only the occasional host. There are besides very
numerous species which have never under any circumstances
been known to bite man. There is no
doubt that some persons are more attractive to fleas
than others. The reason for this we do not know.
It may depend on the tenderness of their skin, the
quality and taste of their blood, or their personal
smell, or possibly all three combined.</p>

<p>The various forms of rat-flea which are important
in carrying plague from rodents to the human race<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
are dealt with later on. Among the commonest fowl-fleas
which bite man are <i>Ceratophyllus gallinæ</i> and
<i>C. gallinulæ</i>. Both species infest the nests of many
common passerine birds besides the domestic fowl.
A common parasite of the pigeon is <i>C. columbæ</i>,
which also bites man.</p>

</div></div>

<p>Dog-fleas and cat-fleas frequently transfer themselves
to man. It has been asserted that the flea of
the dog and the flea of the cat are indistinguishable.
Several great authorities on fleas, such as Dr Carlo
Tiraboschi in Italy and Mr Carl Baker in the United
States, have maintained that the differences between
<i>Ctenocephalus canis</i> and <i>Ct. felis</i> were unreliable
and that they are not distinct species. Mr Charles
Rothschild has, however, shown that the two species
are abundantly distinct. The <i>males</i> of these two
insects can be readily distinguished from each other
by differences exhibited in their respective sexual
organs. The <i>females</i> can be distinguished, at a
glance, by the different shape of their respective
heads. <a href="#i71">Fig. 7</a>, which shows the head of a female
dog-flea above and of a female cat-flea below, illustrates
this. It will be seen that <i>Ct. felis</i> has a much
longer and more pointed head than <i>Ct. canis</i>. In the
<i>males</i> the difference in the shape of the head is less
strongly marked, but is quite perceptible. There are
several minor differences in addition which serve, but
less clearly, to distinguish these two insects. The
first genal spine, or first tooth in the head-comb, is
shorter in the dog-fleas of both sexes than it is in the
cat-fleas. The abdominal stigmata appear to be
larger in a dog-flea than in a cat-flea, and there are
differences in the bristles which seem to be constant.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
Both species are perceptibly larger than human fleas,
and dog-fleas have always afforded good material for
dissection. Very few dogs seem to be exempt from
fleas, and the little pets which are carried in ladies’
arms are often swarming with them.</p>

<p>This account of a despised and detested group of
insects would be very imperfect if it did not mention
those educated or performing fleas which have evoked
so much astonishment among people who have
watched them. It will be best to say, at once, that
the fleas are not educated and that the performance
can only be attributed to their desire to escape. It
is stated that a performing flea may be broken of the
habit of jumping by being put in a pill-box with glass
sides which is made to revolve like a lottery wheel. A
short course of this tread-mill teaches the flea that
the objectionable practice of hopping is useless and
exhausting. It is said that the life of performing
fleas averages eight months, which seems surprising.
They are fed every few days, and the trainers delight
in showing the punctures on their arms where the
swarm of pets has been fed.</p>

<p>Performing fleas are first of all securely fastened,
and this is nine-tenths of the secret, and the art of
education. A very fine silk fibre is put round the
body and knotted on the back. The flea may then
be cemented to some moveable or immoveable object.
It may pull a coach by being attached to a pole made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
of a bristle. A little paper object stuck on its back
is termed by courtesy an equestrian or a ball-dress.
The lively imagination of the spectators is of great
help. The strength of a flea is wonderful, and on
being placed on a sheet of blotting-paper, so that the
hooks of the feet get a hold, the coach travels at a
fine pace. In the intervals of the performance the
coach is turned over, and the performer with its feet
in the air does not get exhausted with needless
struggles. Or else the fleas are fixed head uppermost,
with their legs extended horizontally, to an
upright wire driven into the table. Ladies have fans
of tissue paper gummed to their limbs. Gentlemen
are in the same way supplied with swords made out
of fine segments of wire. When two swordsmen are
placed opposite each other and the table is knocked
they move their limbs. The swords then clash by
chance, and we have a representation of a duel not
much worse than may be seen in provincial or even
London melodrama.</p>

<p>More wonderful are dancing fleas, for there we
have a real representation of a ball-room filled with
waltzers. The orchestra of fleas, all securely fixed
with cement, is placed above a little musical-box.
The music proceeds from the box, but the vibrations
make the fleas gesticulate violently over their musical
instruments. The dancers spin round on the ball-room
floor. The couples are fastened by a rigid bar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
opposite each other, so that they cannot touch or
part. Each is pointed in an opposite direction, and
tries to run away. A rotary motion ensues which, to
the spectators if not to the fleas, is very like waltzing.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER VI</h2>

<p class="pch">THE CHIGOES AND THEIR ALLIES</p>

<p><span class="beg">The</span> chigoes and their allies belong to a group of
fleas sufficiently remarkable to deserve a somewhat
detailed account. The reader may remember that
they form a family to which the name of <i>Sarcopsyllidæ</i>
has been given. They are the most completely
parasitic of any fleas; and the South American chigoe
(<i>Dermatophilus penetrans</i>) enjoys the distinction of
being the first foreign flea ever described. This
pestilent insect, of which the female has the habit
of burrowing into the flesh of the host, soon made
itself known to the early travellers in the tropics of
America. Oviedo, the Spaniard and historiographer
of South America, in his <i>Historia General y Natural
de las Indias</i> (1551), seems to have been the first
European author who mentions it. After this the
chigoe is referred to by writers of various nationalities
in many works which were published during the
sixteenth, seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. It
is an insect which appears under a vast number of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
different names: chigoe, chigue, chego, chigger, chique,
jigger, pico, sico, migua, nigua, ton, and tschike are
synonymous. Catesby in his <i>Natural History of
Carolina</i> (1743) gives a figure of the insect, which is
easily recognisable. Linnæus, in 1758, described the
chigoe as <i>Pulex penetrans</i>, and apparently did not
know much of its appearance beyond what he learnt
from Catesby’s picture. This species and the human
flea were the only two which the great Swedish
naturalist distinguished by a name; though, under
the title <i>Pulex irritans</i>, he includes a number of
different species such as the fleas from the dog, cat,
rabbit and fowl. The chigoe remained the only
member of the family known to scientific entomologists
until the year 1860. An allied insect was then
found on a South American parrot. A third member
of the family was soon after discovered, and is noteworthy
because it was the first species recorded from
the Old World. It is now known to infest the
domestic fowl in all warm countries where these
birds have been introduced by man. A fourth species
was collected from a South American bat. Up to the
present time some fourteen different species (belonging
to three very distinct genera) have been described,
and there cannot be the slightest doubt that, when
collectors in hot countries turn their attention to the
matter, a great many other forms of this interesting
family of fleas will be found.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>The chigoes and their allies are of special interest
for more than one reason. The females are to a
greater or less degree stationary; they fix themselves
firmly to their hosts and become veritable parasites.
Several of the earlier zoologists believed that the
animal was a mite; and it is somewhat remarkable
that Oviedo himself should have so promptly detected
the relationship of the insect he saw with the fleas.
By reason of the parasitic habits of the females, more
is known about their appearance and life than in the
case of the more active males. In some species the
males remain, for the present, quite unknown: and
not very much is recorded about the early life-history,
eggs, larvæ and pupæ of either sex. The parasitic
habits of the chigoes and other allied fleas lead one
to expect peculiar modifications of form such as are
usually to be observed when an animal passes from
an active to a stationary life. These modifications
are the more easily understood as the various species
are not all stationary to the same degree. It is fairly
plain that this family of fleas is a development from
the less specialised and less parasitic family <i>Pulicidæ</i>.
In fact the gradual development of the organs from
a generalised to a more specialised stage is strikingly
shown in these insects. To follow this in detail would,
however, require a very minute and technical knowledge
of their form.</p>

<p>The chigoe family is so well characterised that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
a student of fleas cannot possibly have any doubt
whether a flea belongs to this family or not. Yet
there is great diversity in general appearance, as
well as in details of structure. One very peculiar
character, namely the enormous swelling of the
abdomen in pregnant females is, moreover, shared
with certain other fleas. The most distinguishing
character of the family, however, is the rostrum.
This organ, which it may be well to remind the
reader, consists of the under-lip and the labial palpi,
sheaths the piercing and sucking mouth-parts. In
the chigoes and their allies the rostrum is reduced,
not in length, but in stiffness and in number of
segments. In this group there are never more than
three segments to the rostrum, whilst in the main
group of fleas, with one or two exceptions such as
the rabbit-flea (<i>Spilopsyllus cuniculi</i>), there are
never less than five. There is no indication of a
comb on the head, but all the family, without exception,
have a large triangular projection, which is
more or less curved backwards, at each side of the
head. These two organs doubtless discharge the
same functions as the combs of other fleas, and
prevent the insect from slipping back as it works its
way through the fur or feathers of the host.</p>

<p>The thorax of a chigoe is exceedingly short. Two
reasons for this may be suggested. In the first place,
the jumping power of these fleas is very small and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
the muscles in the thorax are consequently reduced.
In the second place, the value to the insect of a
contracted thorax is obvious; for the abdomen of a
chigoe fixed on or in the skin of an animal does not
project so much as it would were the thorax of normal
length. The troublesome parasite is, therefore, less
likely to be rubbed off by the host.</p>

<p>In most fleas the piercing organs of the mouth
(upper lip and mandibles) are directed obliquely
downwards. In the chigoes they are directed
obliquely forwards. It has been suggested that
this forward movement of the mouth is connected
with the stationary life which the females assume.
Fleas which fasten themselves permanently to the
skin of their host, do so in a manner similar to ticks.
The mouth-parts are in a line with the longitudinal
axis of the body. This attitude, so far as we know,
is assumed by the females of all the family. The
females of one genus, <i>Dermatophilus</i>, actually go head
foremost right into the skin of their host. The shape
of the head is also beautifully adapted to enable the
insect to fix itself firmly in a tick-like posture. The
fore-part is remarkably obtuse, and almost has the
appearance of being truncate and abruptly cut off.
When the piercing organs have been thrown forward
horizontally it must be a great support to the insect,
which is fixed by them, if it can press its head down
firmly against the skin of the host. The wider the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
extent of forehead which can be pressed against the
skin of the host the less the strain on the upper lip
and mandibles, which serve as anchors, when the host
scratches.</p>

<p>All the chigoe family have eyes; but in one
recently discovered species the eye is very small
and devoid of pigment. Like those of other fleas,
the antennæ fit into grooves at the side of the head,
and the club, which is the sensitive part of the organ,
consists of eight segments. In a good many fleas the
antennæ are different in the two sexes, but there is
no obvious sexual distinction in this family.</p>

<p>The peculiar development of the mouth-parts is
one of the most singular features in the structure
of the chigoes and their relatives. These important
organs are modified in a fashion not to be found in
any fleas outside the family. Here, as in other fleas,
the mandibles are piercing organs which penetrate
the skin of the host, the upper lip serving in conjunction
as a sucking tube. In ordinary fleas these
organs are retracted when the insect has done its
meal; in the present family they remain, in the case
of the females, apparently permanently fastened in
the skin. The piercing organs are broader and the
serrate edges of the mandibles more solid and heavy
in this family than in the case of other fleas.</p>

<p>The two methods by which fleas keep in touch
with their hosts have already been alluded to. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
two main fixing and clinging organs are the mouth
and the claws. Weak mouth-parts accompany strong
legs. We observe, accordingly, two lines of development.
The chigoes and their allies present an extreme
case: for the legs are practically useless for holding
on. The bristles, and the claws as well, are exceedingly
thin. In this family the mandibles serve the
purpose of claws. The other line of development is
best seen in a genus of fleas from South America
(<i>Malacopsylla</i>), where the piercing organs are short
and weak, whilst the claws and bristles of the legs
are very strongly developed.</p>

<p>The modification found in the rostrum of the
chigoes has already been referred to, and the explanation
of this will now be understood. The
rostrum is a sheath, on either side of the piercing
organs, consisting of an under lip and two labial
palpi. When the flea sucks, the labial palpi are
pushed asunder, as the piercing organs are driven
in, and lie flat on the skin of the host. In this family
the rostrum is almost white in colour and soft instead
of being horny or chitinised. Where the rostrum is
strongly chitinised or very horny the flea has to use
a certain amount of force to counteract the spring-like
action of the labial palpi. It is conceivable that
rigid labial palpi would prove inconvenient to fleas
which remain permanently attached to their host by
their mouth organs.</p>

American chigoe which burrows into the flesh of the
host. The abdomen swells until it surrounds the head
and thorax, which are shown in the centre. The
natural size is about equal to a small pea.</p>
</div></div>

<p>The swollen abdomen of the female chigoe is a
strange and a conspicuous object, which is not, however,
found occurring to the same extent in all the
members of the family. Having burrowed into the
flesh of a man, or other mammal, the pregnant female
swells and enlarges until she reaches the gigantic
proportions of a small pea. Itching and inflammation
ensue unless the whole insect be skilfully removed
with a needle. To such an extent does the abdomen
swell that the segments and the horny plates
are driven asunder and the connecting membrane<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
between is exposed to view. In the extreme case
of <i>Dermatophilus cæcata</i> from South America the
abdomen swells until it completely envelopes the
head and thorax after the manner shown in <a href="#i81">Fig. 8</a>.
Dr Enderlein found seventeen specimens of this
species in the skin behind the ears of a rat from
Brazil.</p>

<p>The belief that the eggs are laid in the flesh of
the victim is mistaken. The hind segments of the
body and their stigmata are always exposed to the
air. The stigma of the eighth abdominal segment is
particularly large. As soon as the eggs have been
laid, the body of the mother dies, withers, and falls
away from the skin of the host. The fact that several
females are often found where one has buried herself,
led to the notion that these parasites bred in the
wound. The truth seems to be that other chigoes
are attracted to a spot where inflammation has made
it easy to burrow.</p>

<p>Chigoes love warmth and drought. The deserted
huts of natives swarm with them if they are dry. It
is always said that newcomers are more liable to
attack than natives; but the explanation of this
seems to be that they do not understand the significance
of the slight pricks which are felt when the
chigoe fixes itself. Once the parasite has got under
the skin no pain is felt unless the wound is inflamed
by scratching. The tender flesh under toe-nails is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
favourite spot of attack. The only remedy is a sharp
knife and a little antiseptic wash. Pigs and fowls
are sometimes killed by chigoes, and Indians occasionally
are attacked by lockjaw after the parasite has
been removed. But this is not directly attributable
to the chigoe. The eggs are laid one by one; when
this operation is completed the mandibles weaken
and the shrivelled body of the insect can be rubbed
off. But a painful sore may be produced if the
parasite is forcibly broken off and the mouth-parts
are left in the wound.</p>

<p>The chigoe (<i>Dermatophilus penetrans</i>) is a native
originally of South America. It ranges from Mexico
to Northern Argentina. Some time after the middle
of the nineteenth century it was, somehow, carried
across the Atlantic and introduced into West Africa.
From there it has now spread across the Dark Continent
to the Great Lakes, and has even reached
Madagascar. Such are the modern facilities of transport
which parasites are quick to take advantage of.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER VII</h2>

<p class="pch">FLEAS AND PLAGUE</p>

<p><span class="beg">In</span> order to understand the part played by fleas
in the transmission of plague it is necessary to have
some clear elementary knowledge of the nature of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
that disease. Plague is an infectious fever caused by
a specific bacterial organism. <i>Bacillus pestis</i> was
first identified in 1894 by Kitasato, a Japanese, and
immediately afterwards, but independently, by Yersin.
It is an exceedingly minute, short, moderately thick,
oval bacillus, with rounded ends. It has the most
astounding power of rapid multiplication. Nothing
is, at present, known of its natural history outside
the body of the sufferer, but it can be cultivated.
Little is known of its toxic action, but a weak toxin
has been got from cultures. The bacillus itself is
not of a resistant nature and is easily killed by
heat and ordinary germicides. Acids appear to be
fatal to it.</p>

<p>In ordinary cases the bacillus is found in buboes.
A <i>bubo</i> is nothing more than an inflamed gland. In
so-called septicæmic cases it is found in the blood of
the animal afflicted by the disease. In pneumonic
cases the bacillus may be found in the sputum of the
patient. It is the custom to speak of (<i>a</i>) bubonic
plague, (<i>b</i>) septicæmic plague, (<i>c</i>) pneumonic plague,
as though they were three diseases. This is inaccurate:
for they are only forms, with varying
symptoms, of one and the same disease caused by the
same bacillus.</p>

<p>The disease which we call plague is, in truth,
really a fight between the afflicted animal and the
invading bacillus. It may be inferred from the fact<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
that bacilli are scarcely ever found in the blood in
bubonic cases that the invaders are stopped by the
lymphatic glands next above the point of inoculation.
In such cases the fight, which is the illness, takes
place chiefly in the bubo. In non-bubonic cases the
fight goes on in the blood-vessels or in the lungs as
the case may be.</p>

<p>Whether the plague is primarily a disease of rats
would be difficult to say; but rats and other rodents
are very susceptible to it. It has also been transferred
to mice, rabbits, guinea-pigs, squirrels, pigs,
sheep, goats, cattle and horses. Men and monkeys
are equally susceptible. Cats and dogs have been
known to die of it and during the Great Plague of
London many were destroyed under the belief that
they were bearers of infection.</p>

<p>That plague among human beings was associated
with mortality among rats and mice, is an observation
of great antiquity. The student of the Hebrew
scriptures will remember the Book of I Samuel vi. 4:
“Then said they, What shall be the trespass offering
which we shall return to him? They answered, Five
golden emerods [buboes] and five golden mice [rats]
according to the number of the lords of the Philistines:
for one plague was on you all and on your lords.”</p>

<p>Eastern authors, of a later date, refer in several
places to rats, in times of plague, staggering about
as though they were drunk. The Mogul Emperor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
Jehangir in his diary of the plague at Agra (1618)
mentions the unusual mortality of the rats. In India
it seems long to have been a custom, dictated by
experience and caution, to leave houses when rats
began to die. In Europe, during the middle ages,
the mortality of rats when the plague was raging
does not seem to have impressed the chroniclers
and during the recent outbreak at Glasgow (1900)
none was detected.</p>

<p>As an illness of mankind, the plague reached
Europe from the East. We have no evidence of any
outbreak in Europe before the reign of the Emperor
Justinian. When it raged for the first time at Constantinople
(<span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 542) the mortality was enormous.
Ten thousand persons are said to have died in a day
with all the symptoms of bubonic plague.</p>

<p>It spread swiftly through the Roman Empire. In
the fourteenth century the same disease under the
name of the Black Death again ravaged Europe.
Again the mortality was enormous. Millions perished
little suspecting that fleas could be connected with
their fate. Everywhere popular tradition reported
the plague as the most highly contagious of all
diseases.</p>

<p>In the history of science the plague epidemics in
Egypt between 1833 and 1845 are of importance,
because the disease was, for the first time, seriously
studied by skilful French physicians. Some of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
French medical school went so far as to deny contagion
altogether. The modern view is that aerial
infection may be put aside as almost impossible
except in pneumonic cases; but that plague may be
transmitted by any method which inoculates the blood
with <i>Bacillus pestis</i>.</p>

<p>Our modern knowledge dates from the year 1894
when the plague reached Hong Kong. Its existence
as a rat disease was recognised. In the autumn of
1896, when plague broke out in India, the men of
science, who made careful observations on the spot,
were struck by the fact that infection spread from
house to house in a fashion that seemed inexplicable,
unless the bacillus was carried by an animal.</p>

<p>We pass now from rats to fleas. That fleas might
be connected with the spreading of plague was
suggested in the year 1897 when Ogata first found
bacilli in fleas. He obtained fleas from plague-sick
rats. These he crushed, and injected the liquid into
a couple of mice. One of these died of plague
in three days. The German Plague Commission
in Bombay found plague bacilli in fleas, but, for
various reasons, did not consider that the bite of
the flea was the means by which the disease was
transmitted.</p>

<p>The real credit is due to Simond, a Frenchman,
who worked during the Indian epidemics. He took
fleas from infected animals and observed in their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
stomachs bacilli identical with <i>B. pestis</i>. He suggested
that the bacillus was carried from rats to men; and
he brought forward some evidence tending to show
that infected fleas could transmit infection by biting.
But Simond was not able to bring forward conclusive
proof. He pointed out a line of research to others
which has proved exceedingly fruitful. In the same
year (1898) Hankin suggested that some biting insect
might be the means of transmission from rats to man.
The bacillus of plague has now been identified in
ants, bugs, and flies as well as fleas. It seems likely
that any suctorial insect which feeds on a plague-stricken
rat will take numbers of the bacilli into its
stomach.</p>

<p>The points which Simond wished to establish were
that plague-stricken rats with fleas are exceedingly
infective, that they cease to be infective when they
have been deserted by their fleas, and that fleas which
infest rats will transfer themselves to man. Since
1905 an elaborate series of observations and experiments
have been carried out. Post-mortems have
been made of countless rats. Numberless fleas have
been collected and dissected. But this summary
would be very incomplete if it did not mention the
work of Verjbitski, a Russian doctor at Cronstadt,
whose labours remained almost unnoticed although
he made his experiments as long ago as 1902-1903.
His thesis, written in Russian, was not published in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
any scientific journal. But his ingenious and careful
experiments showed that fleas could transmit plague
from animal to animal. He found that the commonest
flea captured off rats at Cronstadt was <i>Leptopsylla
musculi</i>, the usual host of which in other places is the
mouse. Now this flea does not, except very rarely,
bite human beings, and the real significance of the
facts discovered was not appreciated.</p>

<p>The common rat-flea in most parts of Europe is
<i>Ceratophyllus fasciatus</i> and in India and sub-tropical
countries <i>Xenopsylla cheopis</i>. This last species has
acquired the title of “the plague flea,” or, more
accurately, the oriental rat-flea.</p>

<p>During the plague investigations in India many
careful experiments have been made proving beyond
doubt that the disease may be transferred from rat to
rat by the transference of fleas from a septicæmic to
a healthy animal. It was first shown that when fleas
were present the plague could be transferred from
rat to rat, kept in proximity, but carefully screened
so as to avoid any possibility of contact. Next, fleas
were collected from rats dead or dying of septicæmic
plague and transferred to healthy rats living in flea-proof
cages. More than half of the healthy rats
contracted plague. It was shown that if fleas are
present, the disease once started spreads from animal
to animal; and it would seem that the rate of progress
was in direct proportion to the number of fleas present.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>The blood of a plague-infected rat may contain an
enormous number of plague bacilli. Although such
figures do not convey any very clear idea of numbers,
as many as a hundred million bacilli have been found
in a cubic centimetre of rat’s blood. A rat-flea, with
a stomach of average size, might receive therefore as
many as 5000 germs into its stomach; and it is clear
that fleas feeding on a large proportion of plague-infected
rats just before death would be almost
certain to imbibe at least some plague bacilli. There
is, moreover, good evidence for believing that multiplication
of the plague bacilli may take place in the
flea’s stomach. Nor does the blood imbibed by the
flea cease to be infective when it passes from
the stomach. Both the contents of the rectum and
the excrements of fleas taken from plague rats often
contain abundant and actively virulent plague bacilli.
A number of infected fleas are put into a test-tube:
the mouth of the tube is covered with a glass slide,
and the mouth is turned upside down. The fleas are
then seen to run over the slide, and, in a short time,
they deposit an appreciable amount of fæcal matter
on the surface. This under the microscope is seen to
be covered with plague bacilli; and a large percentage
of guinea-pigs, who have an emulsion of the fæcal
matter injected into them, contract plague.</p>

<p>It is remarkable that, so far as we know at
present, the plague bacillus is confined to the flea’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
alimentary canal. On rare occasions it is found in
the gullet when fleas have been killed immediately
after feeding on septicæmic blood. But no plague
bacillus has been found in the body-cavity or in the
salivary glands.</p>

<p>In the stomach of the flea, plague bacilli have
been found in vast numbers twelve and even twenty
days after the insect has imbibed septicæmic blood.
It is naturally of great practical importance to know
how long fleas taken from plague-infected rats remain
infective: that is to say, are capable of transmitting
the infection to healthy animals. Two series of careful
experiments, made during the epidemic plague season
in India, have shown that fleas could remain infective
for as long as fifteen days. In a third series of experiments,
made during the non-epidemic season, it
was found that the fleas remained infective for only
seven days.</p>

<p>It has been ascertained that both the male and
the female oriental rat (<i>X. cheopis</i>) flea can transmit
plague.</p>

<p>We come now to one of the most interesting
questions of all: namely, the method by which the
rat-flea transmits plague to a healthy animal.</p>

<p>A variety of suggestions have been made, several
of which can be shortly dismissed. It was thought,
at one time, that infection might be conveyed by the
animal eating the infected fleas. But it is very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
improbable that this means of infection is of any
real importance, even if it may sometimes occur.
Experiments in feeding have shown that an animal is
unlikely to become infected by swallowing material
containing plague bacilli, unless the amount is considerable.
Moreover we know that infected fleas
confined in test-tubes readily convey the disease when
allowed to bite an animal. In such cases the situation
of the primary bubo corresponds with the area of
skin upon which the fleas are placed. That the
transmission of plague is due to the <i>bite</i> of the flea
seems abundantly clear.</p>

<p>It has also been suggested that the proboscis of
the flea acts as a mechanical instrument for the
transference of the bacilli. No doubt the outside
surface of the flea’s proboscis must become contaminated,
when it sucks the blood of a plague-stricken
rat; but it is difficult to suppose that
contamination of the proboscis can explain cases of
continued infectivity during which the flea has been
feeding regularly upon healthy animals.</p>

<p>Next, there is a hypothesis that the salivary
glands of the flea become infected and that the bacilli
are inoculated along with the saliva. The reader
will remember that when a flea sucks, a stream of
saliva is pumped down the mandibles into the puncture.
But this hypothesis is shattered by the fact that plague
bacilli are apparently confined to the alimentary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
canal of the flea, and that they have never been
found in the salivary glands.</p>

<p>An apparently more probable explanation, that
the contents of the stomach (in which as we know
the bacilli may multiply) are regurgitated and transferred
to the wound by the mouth-parts, is rendered
less credible when we remember that there is a
valvular arrangement at the opening of the flea’s
stomach which seems to make such a thing impossible.</p>

<p>Lastly, there remains the only theory on which
we have positive evidence. It is the theory that the
bacilli contained in the fæces of the flea are deposited
on the skin and then find their way into the wound
made by the piercing organ. They may be helped in
this by the rubbing and scratching which follow on
the bite of the flea. We know, of course, that plague
bacilli are present in abundance in the fæces of fleas
taken from plague-sick rats, and that such fæces
are infective to guinea-pigs both by cutaneous and by
subcutaneous inoculation. Experiments were made
to discover whether the pricks made by fleas were of
sufficient size to allow plague bacilli to enter the
body, no other damage to the skin being done. Healthy
fleas, confined in a test-tube, were allowed to feed on
a small part of a guinea-pig’s abdomen, the hair of
which had been cropped close without injuring the
skin Immediately afterwards a few drops of the
septicæmic blood of a rat which had died of plague,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
or of a virulent culture of plague bacillus, were
lightly spread over the part. Many successful infections
were obtained in this way.</p>

<p>Similar experiments were made in which the
plague culture was first spread on the skin, and,
afterwards, healthy fleas were allowed to feed on the
same spot. Successful infections were also obtained
by this means.</p>

<p>Two facts then seem to be demonstrated beyond
doubt: first, that the puncture made by a flea will
allow the bacillus to gain access to an animal’s body
and to infect it; secondly, that there is a possibility
of infection by the fæces of fleas.</p>

<p>As to whether this is the usual process the highest
authorities are not ready to express any opinion.
The safest course appears to be to kill fleas but to
avoid rubbing them in.</p>

<p>Good work was done during the recent outbreak
of plague in San Francisco when the energies of an
army of men were directed to controlling and destroying
the rat population. Enormous numbers of
rats were killed, their breeding places were destroyed
and everything was made as uncomfortable for them
as possible. Men of science were at the same time
engaged in collecting and examining the fleas from
many thousands of rats. The great success of the
work confirmed the soundness of the theory on which
it was based. The spread of the most terrible of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
epidemic diseases was controlled and prevented by
knowledge. At San Francisco the fleas of man, rats,
mice, dogs, cats, ground-squirrels and gophers were
studied. It was found there, as elsewhere, that while
each species of flea has its particular host few are
unwilling or unable to attack man and other animals
when the host dies.</p>

<p>There is good reason to believe that during the
last outbreak of plague in Manchuria the fleas carried
the bacillus from the marmots (<i>Arctomys</i>) to man.</p>

<p>Plague can be transmitted by the human flea;
but it may be doubted whether this often occurs
under natural conditions. The rat-fleas seem inclined
to take more readily to mankind than the human fleas
do to rats. Experiments at Bombay seemed to show
that, though the human flea was able to transmit the
plague infection, it does not transmit it as readily as
the oriental rat-flea. An explanation of this was
obtained when it was discovered that <i>Pulex irritans</i>
does not live well either on rats, or on guinea-pigs,
which were the subjects of the experiments. A count
of the fleas was made, each day, in a number of
experimental cages, in which live human fleas were
placed in company with wild Bombay rats. A great
number of human fleas were put into a flea-proof
cage along with a rat. Each day a census was taken
of the fleas still alive. After twenty-fours hours it
was found that little more than one per cent. of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
fleas put in could be recovered, and no fleas were ever
found alive after the fifth day.</p>

<p>The European rat-flea (<i>Ceratophyllus fasciatus</i>)
seems to be quite as readily able to transmit plague
as the oriental insect. How far other fleas are able
to transfer infection we have little or no knowledge.
But twenty-seven experiments to transmit plague
from animal to animal by means of cat-fleas (<i>Ctenocephalus
felis</i>) were once made and none of these were
successful. The reason for the failure we do not
know.</p>

<p>If infected fleas are kept in captivity after they
have fed on septicæmic blood, it is found that, after
a while, they are no longer able to convey infection.
On being dissected no bacilli are found in them.
A clearing process, therefore, evidently goes on. If
a number of fleas be fed on a septicæmic rat and,
subsequently, be kept under observation and nourished
on healthy animals, the proportion found to be infected
steadily diminishes day by day. It is remarkable
that the existence of numerous plague bacilli in
the stomach of a flea does not seem materially to
affect the insect’s life. Fleas, in other words, do not
suffer from plague though they can transmit it.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<p class="pch">RAT-FLEAS AND BAT-FLEAS</p>

<p><span class="beg">The</span> chief conclusions arrived at, as the result of
the investigations, during the years 1905 to 1909,
into the mode of spread of plague in India, may be
briefly stated in the following fashion: The Advisory
Committee, under whose direction the investigation
was carried out, consider that: firstly, in nature,
plague is spread among rats by the agency of
rat-fleas; secondly, bubonic plague is not directly
infectious from man to man; thirdly, in the great
majority of cases, during an epidemic of plague,
man contracts the disease from plague-infected rats
through the agency of plague-infected rat-fleas;
fourthly, where there are annual epidemics they
occur during some part of that season when the
prevalence of fleas is greatest.</p>

<p>That being so, it is manifest that an accurate
knowledge of rat-fleas, their forms, their habits, and
their life-history may prove of great importance.</p>

<p>Three species of the genus <i>Mus</i> follow quickly
in the wake of civilized man and establish themselves
all over the globe. They may all be looked
upon as more or less domestic animals. The house-mouse
(<i>M. musculus</i>) is familiar everywhere. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
old black rat (<i>M. rattus</i>) chiefly infests ships and
seaports. The brown rat (<i>M. norwegicus</i>) is the
most aggressive and distinctive. But all three, by
accidental transference from port to port in ocean-going
vessels, have become distributed over the
world. Their fleas, to a limited extent, have become
distributed with them. In connection with
the spread of plague these three small rodents are
of prime importance; and not less important are
the fleas which are parasitic on them.</p>

<p>In California, the ground-squirrel (<i>Otospermophilus
beecheyi</i>) has been proved to play an important
part in plague infection; and a full account of its
fleas, and of experiments in transferring rat-fleas
to squirrels and squirrel-fleas to rats, has been

<p>In 1903 Dr Blue, who was in charge of measures
for suppressing plague at San Francisco, observed
that an epidemic disease was killing the ground-squirrels
in the country round San Francisco Bay.
It was shown, somewhat later, that the mortality
among the squirrels was caused by plague, and there
can be little doubt that it was transferred from rats
to squirrels. In harvest time rats migrate to the
fields and use the same runs and holes as the
squirrels. Under these conditions a transfer of fleas
from rats to ground-squirrels is almost certain to
ensue. Two species of flea have been recorded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
from the Californian ground-squirrel, and both are
parasites of rats. The chain of evidence is really
complete, for those who have made a business of
hunting ground-squirrels testify to the readiness
with which fleas will leave a dead squirrel and
bite a human being. In the records of plague in
California there are several cases in which there
seems to be very little doubt that the disease
resulted from handling plague-infected squirrels.</p>

<p>Fleas being wingless insects travel with considerable
difficulty over the ground; and though their
hopping powers are notorious they are unable to
make any long-continued progress in this way. The
methods by which they get dispersed are of interest.
Some may be carried by the host in its natural
wanderings. Rats appear to be constantly picking
up and dropping fleas. Sick rats harbour more
fleas than others and therefore more frequently drop
them. A hundred fleas have been collected off one
plague-sick rat; and, as we know, if this rat was
moribund, some of these fleas would most likely be
infected. It is obvious that a plague-sick rat may
travel about leaving as it wanders a trail of infected
fleas behind it. Rats, too, are frequently transported
with certain kinds of merchandise and carry their
fleas to the most distant parts of the globe, travelling
with all the speed and luxury which modern steamships
afford. Rats will dive into sacks of grain or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
bran and hide, so that the bag can be loaded as
cargo without anyone suspecting the presence of a
rat inside. <i>M. rattus</i> and its fleas, from the habits
of the host, are especially likely to be transported
in this way. Besides, many fleas are now dispersed
without their hosts in merchandise of various kinds.
They may travel great distances in these days of
rapid transport, though adult fleas, without a host
to feed on, generally die in about five days. But
larvæ, which eat organic rubbish, and pupæ, which
do not eat at all, might arrive alive at the end of
a journey of well over a month. On arrival, they
would seek their true host, or the next best available
animal. Not having yet fed, and being newly emerged,
they might survive as long as a fortnight without a
suitable host.</p>

<p>Fleas dislike damp breeding places, but dirty
carpets, chopped straw, old sacking, paper shavings,
and such-like rubbish suit them admirably.</p>

<p><i>M. rattus</i> is fond of making nests on grain bags
and in such sacking the larvæ of fleas are often
found. Where trade is carried on in sacks and
gunny bags this means of distributing fleas and
plague should be kept in mind.</p>

<p>Some rat-fleas, as we know, will feed on man
as well as on rats; but their behaviour is rather
different when they feed on rats and on man. It
has been repeatedly noticed that the fleas were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
much more readily attracted by the rat than by
man. Although the fleas jump on to a man’s hand
they take some time to begin to feed. They crawl
about and seem to have some doubt where best
to begin their sucking operations. Also it has been
observed that the fleas much more readily fall off
a man’s arm, when he moves, than they do when
a rat moves. It seems that they are able to get a
firmer hold on the rat than on a man; and it is
of interest to note in this connection the larger
claws of the human flea compared with the claws
of the rat-flea.</p>

<p>It has been shown, in various parts of India,
that the number of rat-fleas found on rats varies
with the seasons. This seasonal variation of rat-fleas
corresponds in a general way with the plague
mortality. During the season when plague is bad
the average number of fleas per rat is above the
mean. During the non-epidemic season it is below the
mean. The height of the epidemic corresponds fairly
closely with the season of maximum flea prevalence.</p>

<p>Nineteen species of <i>Pulicidæ</i> are more or less
habitually obtained by collectors on rats and mice.
But the great majority of these may be called casual
visitors. Six species of <i>Sarcopsyllidæ</i> are also occasionally
found on rats. These are the burrowing
chigoes and their allies which usually attack the head
and ears of rats.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>The species of flea commonly found on rats are
five in number, and the readiness with which they
bite human beings has been carefully studied.</p>

<p>1. <i>Xenopsylla cheopis.</i> This is the oriental rat-flea
first described by Mr Charles Rothschild from
specimens collected in Egypt. The true home of
this flea appears to be the Nile valley, where it may
be found in plenty on various hosts. Many of these
are desert animals and the flea shows a preference
for rodents. Having been distributed all over the
world by rats, it now occurs, occasionally, in all warm
climates. It is the common rat-flea of the tropical
and sub-tropical world. In India it often happens
that the whole of the fleas collected from rats prove
to be of this species. But it cannot, apparently,
flourish in cold countries. In the warmer temperate
zones, such as the Mediterranean and Australian seaports,
it occurs in varying proportions according to
the time of year. The numbers decline with cold
weather. It readily bites man and is more active
than any other flea in the transmission of plague.
For this reason it is sometimes spoken of as “the
Plague-flea.” It is a smaller and a lighter coloured
insect than the human flea.</p>

<p>2. <i>Ceratophyllus fasciatus.</i> This is the common
European rat-flea. It is the rat-flea of the temperate
as opposed to the hot countries of the world. It
is commonly found on black and brown rats in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
British Islands and the other countries of Northern
and Central Europe. It readily bites man, and there
is no reason to suppose that, other conditions being
equal, it would not be as efficient an agent in
spreading plague as the last species has been shown
to be in India.</p>

<p>3. <i>Ceratophyllus anisus.</i> This is a closely allied
species of rat-flea which replaces the last in China
and Japan.</p>

<p>4. <i>Leptopsylla musculi.</i> This is the mouse-flea
and it is as widely distributed over the globe as its
host. From mice it frequently moves to rats, and
it has been found on them in various parts of Europe,
America, Australia, and Japan. It occasionally bites
man, but evinces little inclination to do so.</p>

<p>5. <i>Ctenophthalmus agyrtes.</i> This flea is commonly
found as a parasite of voles and field-mice. When
farm-rats take to an open life in the fields they pick
up this species from the rustic rodents. In Hertfordshire,
Hampshire and Suffolk one half the fleas from
rats, collected in farmyards and hedgerows, were
found to belong to this species; but whether it is
as common on rats all over England is unknown.
It appears not to bite man. A closely allied flea
(<i>Ct. assimilis</i>) is found in central Europe on field-mice
and equally on rats which live under the same
conditions. It has not been found in England.</p>

<p>The principal occasional parasites of rats are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
dog-fleas, cat-fleas, fowl-fleas, and human fleas. The
proportions in which they and rat-fleas are found
vary greatly in different parts of the world. For
instance, in San Francisco nine per cent. of the fleas
collected from rats have sometimes been found to be
human fleas; whilst in Italy as many as twenty-five
per cent. have been identified as cat-and dog-fleas.</p>

<p>It must be borne in mind that when new countries
are opened up by man the rats, which follow in his
rear, exterminate numbers of the weakly native
small mammals and take on their fleas. A change
of habitat may be followed by an exchange of
fleas.</p>

<p>Some interesting work has been done in testing
the appetite of different kinds of flea for human
blood. The oriental rat-flea (<i>X. cheopis</i>) has been
kept alive for three weeks on that diet. Other
species show repulsion for mankind and refuse to
suck. The experiments confirm the popular belief
that fleas have a marked preference for certain
individuals. When the flea has refused to bite the
human arm, it becomes necessary to check the experiment
by trying whether the refusal is merely
due to want of hunger. For this purpose a rat
must be at hand. It can be secured on a board
by two bandages fixed at each end by drawing pins.
The rat lies, of course, on its back with its head
comfortably supported by a little pillow of cotton<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
wool. A portion of the rat’s abdominal wall is left
exposed and shaved. The flea, in an inverted test-tube,
can then be put on the hairless patch of the
abdomen and given an opportunity of biting, which
it may or may not accept.</p>

<p>When fleas are being collected from rats it has
been noticed that the true rat-fleas are usually on
the hind-quarters of the host, whilst the mouse-flea
prefers the region of the head and neck.</p>

<p>As regards the tastes and habits of oriental rat-fleas
in the matter of food a long series of experiments
may be summarized in this way:</p>

<p>(1) When many rat-fleas are present some will
attack man, even when a rat is available for their
food-supply. (2) When the number of rat-fleas is
small, and when their true host is present, they will
not attack man. (3) When rat-fleas are starved
they will readily attack all animals, not being
particular in the choice of a host. (4) Rat-fleas
deprived of their food for from 72 to 96 hours
attack and feed on man more readily than at other
times. (5) Rat-fleas, even when starved, prefer
their true host to man. (6) Rat-fleas may be
attracted to man, jump on him, but take some time
to feed on him. Plague-infected fleas might in this
way be carried from one place to another without
infecting the man; but they would, when brought
near a rat, attack it in preference to man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<p>The fleas found on bats possess certain peculiarities
which have led to their being grouped together.
They form a family to which the name <i>Ceratopsyllidæ</i>
has been given. They are recognized by two flaps,
one on each side of the head. What these are and
what service, if any, they render to their possessors
is unknown. Bat-fleas also, as a rule, have maxillæ
shaped like dumb-bells; but in one genus (<i>Thaumopsylla</i>),
found on fruit-bats, they are triangular
as in other fleas. The maxillæ as the reader may
remember, are parts of the insect’s mouth, and,
though placed like jaws on each side of the aperture,
they are not used in piercing the skin and sucking
blood (<a href="#i43">Fig. 4</a>). They bear feelers called the maxillary
palpi. The flea (<i>Thaumopsylla breviceps</i>) which is
found on South African fruit-bats and which has
triangular maxillæ, seems to be a connecting link
between this peculiar group of fleas and the main
family <i>Pulicidæ</i>.</p>

<p>Bat-fleas are commonly well supplied with combs.
They usually have them on the abdomen, as well as
the head, and the maximum number of eight combs
is found in bat-fleas. Their structure and life-history
agree generally with that of other fleas. They breed
in hollow trees, caves, ruins, church-towers and lofts
where bats hibernate or spend the hours of daylight.
The larvæ feed on the droppings of the bats, and the
mature insect, after emerging from the pupa case,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
takes the first opportunity that comes of getting on
to its host. Bats are seldom found to be much
infested with fleas; for this reason, bat-fleas are
somewhat difficult to obtain and many of the species
that are known are extremely rare.</p>

<p>The hosts of bat-fleas, obviously, vary more as to
the surroundings which they inhabit than almost any
other animals. They are found from the equator
north and south to the Arctic circle and the straits
of Magellan, in the densest tropical forests and flitting
round the barest northern buildings. Some pillage
the rich fruit gardens of India, whilst other smaller
bats work hard for a precarious diet of gnats round
a Siberian village. Two sharply divided groups of
bats exist: (1) The fruit-bats (Macrochiroptera) with
flat molar teeth adapted for a vegetable diet. These
are found in the warmer parts of the Old World but
not in America. (2) The insectivorous bats (Microchiroptera)
whose molar teeth are equipped with
sharp cusps for biting their animal food. These have
an almost world-wide distribution, and one species at
least ranges within the Arctic circle. The same fleas
are not as a rule found on the large fruit-bats as on
the small ordinary bats. But some bat-fleas have an
extensive range. The same species has been taken
from different bats of various kinds in Sierra Leone,
in Madagascar and in Java.</p>

<p>All bat-fleas are blind. This absence of eyes, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
fleas which are parasites of strictly nocturnal animals,
lends colour to the suggestion that fleas which are
blind have lost their eyes because they had no need
of them. Disuse is speedily followed by degeneration.</p>

<p class="pc lmid">Order <span class="smcap">Siphonaptera</span>. Latreille (1825).</p>


<p class="p2">Insects with body laterally compressed. Head
rounded and fixed by the whole posterior part to the
thorax. Mouth-parts for piercing and sucking, consisting
of paired mandibles with serrate margins and
unpaired labrum. These are sheathed by the labium
and labial palpi. Maxillæ usually triangular with
four-jointed palpi. Eyes simple, placed in front of
the antennæ, occasionally rudimentary or absent.
Antennæ of three main segments which lie when at
rest in a groove. Three thoracic segments, always
free, each consisting of a notum and a sternum. The
sterna of the second and third segments are further
divided into a sternum, an episternum and an
epimeron, the two latter constituting the pleura.
Wings and rudiments of wings entirely absent.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
Abdomen of ten segments of which the sternite of
the first segment is suppressed. Abdomen enormously
swollen in pregnant females of certain species. Combs
frequently present on head, thorax, and abdomen.
Legs developed for leaping. Coxa powerful; femur
thickened; tarsi of five segments, ending in two claws
on the distal segment. Metamorphosis complete.
Larva of thirteen segments. Pupa enveloped in silken
cocoon. Imago a temporary parasite (usually) on
warm-blooded vertebrates.</p>


<p class="p1">I. Family <i>Sarcopsyllidæ</i>. Taschenberg (1880).</p>

<p>Rostrum (= labium + labial palpi) rather long
but very weak and pale, consisting of two or three
segments inclusive of the unpaired basal segment.
Genal edge of head always produced downwards into
a triangular process situated behind the insertion of
the maxillæ at the ventral oral angle. Thoracical
tergites together shorter than first abdominal tergite.</p>

<p>To this group belong the chigoes and their allies,
the most truly parasitic fleas. About fourteen species
have been described, which can be grouped into three
genera, viz. <i>Dermatophilus, Hectopsylla, Echidnophaga</i>.</p>


<p class="p1">II. Family <i>Pulicidæ</i>. Taschenberg (1880).</p>

strongly chitinized, consisting, except in a few cases,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
of five, or more, segments inclusive of the unpaired
basal one. Thoracical tergites together longer than
first abdominal tergite.</p>

<p>Here belong the majority of <i>Siphonaptera</i>.</p>

<p class="p1">III. Family <i>Ceratopsyllidæ</i>. Baker (1905).</p>

<p>Head on each side with two flaps situated at the

<h2 class="p4">APPENDIX C</h2>

<p class="pch">ON COLLECTING AND PRESERVING FLEAS</p>

<p>There are two methods by which fleas may be
preserved for study when they have been collected.
The first is by keeping the specimens in small tubes
of alcohol; the second is by mounting each in Canada
balsam on a slide for the microscope. The advantage
of the former method is that the material can be used
for dissection. The student can do nothing without
a microscope, though some of the commoner species
can be identified with tolerable certainty by a
practised eye which is assisted by a pocket-lens.</p>

<p>The tubes are best stored away in a cabinet fitted
with wooden shelves and holes to take the tubes like
a test-tube holder. Fleas dried and preserved loose
in a box, or gummed on card, are useless for purposes
of minute examination, and are soon destroyed.</p>

<p>Fleas may be collected from the great majority of
mammals and birds in almost all parts of the globe.
They can be found in the hair and under the feathers,
and also in the places where the animals habitually
sleep. The best places, from which a plentiful haul
may often be obtained, are the holes and nests in
which the young have been reared.</p>

<p>It is essential to remember, when an animal has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
been killed, that all the fleas leave as soon as the
body of the host gets cold. No time, therefore, should
be lost in searching for specimens.</p>

<p>If the animal is small enough it may be put into
a cardboard box, or a white linen bag, and a few
drops of chloroform or benzine can be poured on it.
In a short time the fleas will be found dead in the
bag or at the bottom of the box. Some may also be
found in the hairs and feathers when they are turned
back.</p>

<p>In the case of a large mammal the hair must be
turned backwards shortly after death, when the live
fleas may be seen running about and caught. For
this purpose a small camel’s hair brush is very useful.
If a flea is touched with a brush of this kind which
has been dipped in chloroform, benzine, or alcohol,
the insect sticks to the brush, but can be easily floated
off into the tube of preservative. The best preserving
liquid is 50 per cent. alcohol. Methylated spirits can
be used. Acetic acid can also be used; but it is
objectionable because in a short time it destroys the
corks of the tubes.</p>

<p>Each tube should only contain the fleas collected
from one host, but as many specimens as possible
should be secured, because there may be several
species of flea on the same host.</p>

<p>The tube must be securely corked and labelled,
with the date, the locality, and the name of the host.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
In foreign countries it may not be always easy to do
this. In such cases the skin of the host must be
preserved with the tube for subsequent identification.
A number corresponding to the label on the tube
should be attached to the skin of the host.</p>

<p>Fleas collected without records of the host from
which they were obtained are of little or no scientific
value. For this reason a tube should contain the
parasites of one host only.</p>

<p>A convenient way of preserving records temporarily
is to write in <i>pencil</i> on a small piece of paper which
can be rolled up and put in the alcohol in the tube.</p>

<p>Small mammals generally, including bats, are good
hosts; Rodents and Insectivora afford usually the most
fruitful captures. In trapping mice and voles only
those traps should be used in which the animals are
caught alive, or the fleas will have left their hosts
before they can be secured and examined. Field-mice
caught in the ordinary small penny mouse-trap
are often found dead in the morning. The best traps
are made on the principle of the ordinary mouse-trap,
but larger. A piece of bacon-rind on the hook is a
good bait for almost all small mammals. Where
a number of traps are put down and left out they
should, of course, be visited daily.</p>

<p>When a live mouse, or other small mammal of
similar size, has been captured it may be transferred
from the trap into a small white linen or holland bag.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
The animal can then be killed by tapping its head or
breaking its neck from the outside of the bag. After
this has been done, fleas may be searched for in the
fashion described above.</p>

<p>Most of the small mammals which act as hosts for
fleas are nocturnal. The localities where they may
be trapped are numberless, but only a small proportion
of the captures may yield anything for the
flea-collector. I have heard of a collector of small
mammals who travelled through remote parts of Spain
and never lost an occasion for putting down his traps
when he had to change trains at a country railway
junction. In England it would, however, seldom be
worth doing this, as, on many lines, there is an attempt
to make the arrival of one train and the departure
of another correspond.</p>

<p>The following plan for securing bird-fleas will be
found successful. The nests of birds should be taken
as soon as the young are fledged and flown. If the
nest is small it can be put into a glass-topped box
lined with white paper. If too large, the whole nest,
or the most firmly matted and dirty part, may be put
into a glass globe (such as gold-fish are kept in) and
a piece of paper tied over the mouth. From time to
time the nest should be slightly damped with water.
In every case a label should be put into the receptacle
to preserve the name of the bird which built the nest.
The bottom of the nest may sometimes be seen to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
full of the larval fleas; but in any case fleas will
probably emerge from pupæ. The fleas will continue
appearing for as much as six weeks or eight weeks
after the young birds have left the nest. They must
be watched for and taken off the sides and top of the
box with a camel’s hair brush dipped in chloroform
or benzine. I have seen dozens of fleas come from
the nest of a tit (<i>Parus major</i>) in the course of a
few weeks. They were all of the common species
(<i>C. gallinæ</i>). When the lid of the box is removed it
is difficult to prevent a few escaping in the room, but
I have never known them cause inconvenience to
anyone.</p>

<p>Collectors in warm countries should give their
attention to the chigoes and their allies, which are
of great interest and have been little studied. They
are found on mammals and birds in tropical and
semi-tropical countries. The males are very difficult
to find, but the females are large and very parasitic.
They have the appearance of a small wart firmly fixed
to the skin. Small mammals may be transferred,
with their chigoes attached, to a bottle of alcohol.
Many examples of these insects are often found
together on the more naked portions of their hosts.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
  www.gutenberg.org/license.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
